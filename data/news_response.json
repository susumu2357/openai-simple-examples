            "title": "Redfall release time: here's when you can start hunting vampires",
            "text": "Redfall is launching tomorrow on Tuesday May 2, and players are keen to know exactly when they can jump in and bash up some vampires in Arkane Austin's latest open world title. Bethesda's first Xbox exclusive \u2013 following Microsoft's purchase of Bethesda back in 2020 \u2013 is finally upon us, Arkane Austin's open world vampire hunting simulator Redfall. Despite the game receiving some bad news on the leadup to release (such as a 30fps lock on Xbox Series X, and that a PlayStation version was in development, but cancelled following the buyout) plenty of us are keen to try out Arkane's latest considering the studios incredible track record with games like Deathloop and Prey under its belt. Plus, it's going to be Xbox Game Pass at no extra cost for players on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and PC with crossplay enabled between all three (sadly, it's skipping Xbox One alongside PS4 and PS5). Redfall launches tomorrow, on Tuesday, May 2, and is a four-player co-op shooter in which you and a sqaud of fellow vampire hunters must \u2013 shocker \u2013 hunt vampires in the titular town. There are four unique characters to choose from in the game, each with their own set of skills and abilities, such as the telekinetic-enhanced Layla Ellison or stealthy soldier man Jacob Boyer. The game is available to preload now on Xbox Series X|S and PC, with the special Redfall Bite Back Edition also available (offering some extra cosmetic goodies). Redfall release time Arkane has confirmed the exact time that players will be able to boot up Redfall on it's Twitter account, and that will be on Tuesday, May 2 at 1am BST for the UK and Monday, May 1 at 8pm EDT / 5pm PDT for the US. The game will release at the same time globally so the typical Xbox tactic of changing your location to New Zealand sadly won't do you any good this time. As we mentioned the preload is available now. Considering the game is a whopping 103.29GB on PC, it's no slouch on console either, coming in at 77.31GB on Xbox Series X and 40.37GB on Xbox Series S so we'd recommend getting that preload installed as soon as possible so you can start your career in vampire hunting as soon as possible.",

            "text": "Chatbots like ChatGPT are used by hundreds of millions of people for an increasingly wide array of tasks, including email services, online tutors and search engines. And they could change the way people interact with information. But there is no way of ensuring that these systems produce information that is accurate. The technology, called generative A.I., relies on a complex algorithm that analyzes the way humans put words together on the internet. It does not decide what is true and what is not. That uncertainty has raised concerns about the reliability of this new kind of artificial intelligence and calls into question how useful it can be until the issue is solved or controlled. The tech industry often refers to the inaccuracies as \u201challucinations.\u201d But to some researchers, \u201challucinations\u201d is too much of a euphemism. Even researchers within tech companies worry that people will rely too heavily on these systems for medical and legal advice and other information they use to make daily decisions. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know an answer to a question already, I would not give the question to one of these systems,\u201d said Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor and researcher of artificial intelligence at Arizona State University. ChatGPT wasn\u2019t alone in erring on the first reference to A.I. in The Times. Google\u2019s Bard and Microsoft\u2019s Bing chatbots both repeatedly provided inaccurate answers to the same question. Though false, the answers seemed plausible as they blurred and conflated people, events and ideas.",

            "text": "A neural network is a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing data. About five years ago, companies like Google, Microsoft and OpenAI began building neural networks that learned from huge amounts of digital text called large language models, or L.L.M.s. By pinpointing patterns in that text, L.L.M.s learn to generate text on their own, including blog posts, poems and computer programs. They can even carry on a conversation. This technology can help computer programmers, writers and other workers generate ideas and do things more quickly. But Dr. Bengio and other experts also warned that L.L.M.s can learn unwanted and unexpected behaviors. These systems can generate untruthful, biased and otherwise toxic information. Systems like GPT-4 get facts wrong and make up information, a phenomenon called \u201challucination.\u201d Companies are working on these problems. But experts like Dr. Bengio worry that as researchers make these systems more powerful, they will introduce new risks.",

            "text": "Until last year, he said, Google acted as a \u201cproper steward\u201d for the technology, careful not to release something that might cause harm. But now that Microsoft has augmented its Bing search engine with a chatbot \u2014 challenging Google\u2019s core business \u2014 Google is racing to deploy the same kind of technology. The tech giants are locked in a competition that might be impossible to stop, Dr. Hinton said. His immediate concern is that the internet will be flooded with false photos, videos and text, and the average person will \u201cnot be able to know what is true anymore.\u201d He is also worried that A.I. technologies will in time upend the job market. Today, chatbots like ChatGPT tend to complement human workers, but they could replace paralegals, personal assistants, translators and others who handle rote tasks. \u201cIt takes away the drudge work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might take away more than that.\u201d Down the road, he is worried that future versions of the technology pose a threat to humanity because they often learn unexpected behavior from the vast amounts of data they analyze. This becomes an issue, he said, as individuals and companies allow A.I. systems not only to generate their own computer code but actually run that code on their own. And he fears a day when truly autonomous weapons \u2014 those killer robots \u2014 become reality. \u201cThe idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people \u2014 a few people believed that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.\u201d",

            "title": "\u2018The Godfather of AI\u2019 Leaves Google and Warns of Danger Ahead",
            "text": "Written by Cade Metz Geoffrey Hinton was an artificial intelligence pioneer. In 2012, Hinton and two of his graduate students at the University of Toronto created technology that became the intellectual foundation for the AI systems that the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies believe is a key to their future. On Monday, however, he officially joined a growing chorus of critics who say those companies are racing toward danger with their aggressive campaign to create products based on generative AI, the technology that powers popular chatbots like ChatGPT. Hinton said he has quit his job at Google, where he has worked for more than decade and became one of the most respected voices in the field, so he can freely speak out about the risks of AI. A part of him, he said, now regrets his life\u2019s work. \u201cI console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn\u2019t done it, somebody else would have,\u201d Hinton said during a lengthy interview last week in the dining room of his home in Toronto, a short walk from where he and his students made their breakthrough. Hinton\u2019s journey from AI groundbreaker to doomsayer marks a remarkable moment for the technology industry at perhaps its most important inflection point in decades. Industry leaders believe the new AI systems could be as important as the introduction of the web browser in the early 1990s and could lead to breakthroughs in areas ranging from drug research to education. But gnawing at many industry insiders is a fear that they are releasing something dangerous into the wild. Generative AI can already be a tool for misinformation. Soon, it could be a risk to jobs. Somewhere down the line, tech\u2019s biggest worriers say, it could be a risk to humanity. \u201cIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,\u201d Hinton said. After the San Francisco startup OpenAI released a new version of ChatGPT in March, more than 1,000 technology leaders and researchers signed an open letter calling for a six-month moratorium on the development of new systems because AI technologies pose \u201cprofound risks to society and humanity.\u201d Several days later, 19 current and former leaders of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, a 40-year-old academic society, released their own letter warning of the risks of AI. That group included Eric Horvitz, chief scientific officer at Microsoft, which has deployed OpenAI\u2019s technology across a wide range of products, including its Bing search engine. Hinton, often called \u201cthe Godfather of AI,\u201d did not sign either of those letters and said he did not want to publicly criticize Google or other companies until he had quit his job. He notified the company last month that he was resigning, and Thursday, he talked by phone with Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. He declined to publicly discuss the details of his conversation with Pichai. Google\u2019s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, said in a statement: \u201cWe remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We\u2019re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\u201d Hinton, a 75-year-old British expatriate, is a lifelong academic whose career was driven by his personal convictions about the development and use of AI. In 1972, as a graduate student at the University of Edinburgh, Hinton embraced an idea called a neural network. A neural network is a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing data. At the time, few researchers believed in the idea. But it became his life\u2019s work. In the 1980s, Hinton was a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University but left the university for Canada because he said he was reluctant to take Pentagon funding. At the time, most AI research in the United States was funded by the Defense Department. Hinton is deeply opposed to the use of AI on the battlefield \u2014 what he calls \u201crobot soldiers.\u201d In 2012, Hinton and two of his students in Toronto, Ilya Sutskever and Alex Krishevsky, built a neural network that could analyze thousands of photos and teach itself to identify common objects, such as flowers, dogs and cars. Google spent $44 million to acquire a company started by Hinton and his two students. And their system led to the creation of increasingly powerful technologies, including new chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google Bard. Sutskever went on to become chief scientist at OpenAI. In 2018, Hinton and two other longtime collaborators received the Turing Award, often called \u201cthe Nobel Prize of computing,\u201d for their work on neural networks. Around the same time, Google, OpenAI and other companies began building neural networks that learned from huge amounts of digital text. Hinton thought it was a powerful way for machines to understand and generate language, but it was inferior to the way humans handled language. Then, last year, as Google and OpenAI built systems using much larger amounts of data, his view changed. He still believed the systems were inferior to the human brain in some ways but he thought they were eclipsing human intelligence in others. \u201cMaybe what is going on in these systems,\u201d he said, \u201cis actually a lot better than what is going on in the brain.\u201d As companies improve their AI systems, he believes, they become increasingly dangerous. \u201cLook at how it was five years ago and how it is now,\u201d he said of AI technology. \u201cTake the difference and propagate it forwards. That\u2019s scary.\u201d Until last year, he said, Google acted as a \u201cproper steward\u201d for the technology, careful not to release something that might cause harm. But now that Microsoft has augmented its Bing search engine with a chatbot \u2014 challenging Google\u2019s core business \u2014 Google is racing to deploy the same kind of technology. The tech giants are locked in a competition that might be impossible to stop, Hinton said. His immediate concern is that the internet will be flooded with false photos, videos and text, and the average person will \u201cnot be able to know what is true anymore.\u201d He is also worried that AI technologies will in time upend the job market. Today, chatbots such as ChatGPT tend to complement human workers, but they could replace paralegals, personal assistants, translators and others who handle rote tasks. \u201cIt takes away the drudge work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might take away more than that.\u201d Down the road, he is worried that future versions of the technology pose a threat to humanity because they often learn unexpected behavior from the vast amounts of data they analyze. This becomes an issue, he said, as individuals and companies allow AI systems not only to generate their own computer code but actually to run that code on their own. And he fears a day when truly autonomous weapons \u2014 those killer robots \u2014 become reality. \u201cThe idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people \u2014 a few people believed that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.\u201d Many other experts, including many of his students and colleagues, say this threat is hypothetical. But Hinton believes that the race between Google and Microsoft and others will escalate into a global race that will not stop without some sort of global regulation. But that may be impossible, he said. Unlike with nuclear weapons, he said, there is no way of knowing whether companies or countries are working on the technology in secret. The best hope is for the world\u2019s leading scientists to collaborate on ways of controlling the technology. \u201cI don\u2019t think they should scale this up more until they have understood whether they can control it,\u201d he said. Hinton said that when people used to ask him how he could work on technology that was potentially dangerous, he would paraphrase Robert Oppenheimer, who led the U.S. effort to build the atomic bomb: \u201cWhen you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it.\u201d He does not say that anymore.",

            "title": "After Quitting Google, \u2018Godfather of AI\u2019 Is Now Warning of Its Dangers",
            "text": "Megalithic tech companies such as Google, Meta, and Microsoft are so obsessed with AI development it seems impossible to steer any of them toward slowing down and actually thinking about the repercussions. Now one of the most prominent faces in artificially intelligence research, former Googler Dr. Geoffrey Hinton, has come down hard on the full-spring pace of AI development, ultimately calling for some kind of global regulation. According to an interview with The New York Times, Hinton, an award-winning researcher on AI, neural networks, and machine learning, is no longer so comfortable pushing the boundaries of AI development without any kind of regulation or stopgap. The 75-year-old Hinton, who was a lead researcher in any aspects of AI development at Google, has come out saying \u201cIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using [AI] for bad things.\u201d He directly compared himself to Robert Oppenheimer, who helped develop the atomic bomb for the U.S. While Oppenheimer had made statements about pursuing science for sciences sake, Hinton instead said \u201cI don\u2019t think they should scale [AI] up more until they have understood whether they can control it.\u201d He further shared his concerns that AI would lead to massive job disruptions around the world. Hinton got his \u2018Godfather\u2019 title not with any offer you can\u2019t refuse, but from decades of research on AI. This came to a head with the neural network he helped build in 2012 with two of his students at the University of Toronto. That network was a machine learning program that could teach itself to identify objects like dogs, flowers, and so on, and it became a major stepping stone for modern transformer-based AI like diffusion AI image generators and large language models. Google had originally acquired the company formed out of Hinton\u2019s Toronto-based research in 2013. This let him establish a Toronto-based element of the Google Brain team overseeing AI development. After that, Google went on an AI spending spree when it acquired deep learning company DeepMind in 2014. Hinton\u2019s company, according to a 2021 Wired report, received numerous offers from tech giants including Microsoft and China-based Baidu, both of which are deep in the muck with their own push into AI development. In a March interview with CBS News, Hinton compared the recent rapid advancements in AI to \u201cthe Industrial revolution or electricity\u2014or maybe the wheel.\u201d It\u2019s unclear when Hinton made this heel-turn, but just a few months ago he was instead referring to AI as a \u201csupernaturally precocious child.\u201d He compared AI training to caterpillars feeding on nutrients to become butterflies, further calling OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 large language model \u201chumanity\u2019s butterfly.\u201d According to the Times, in April Hinton told Google he planned to leave, and finally cut the cord after a call with CEO Sundar Pichai last Thursday. Though The New York Times implied that Hinton had left Google in order to specifically take umbrage with his old boss, the Turing Award winner claimed he only wished to speak up on the dangers of AI, adding \u201cGoogle has acted very responsibly.\u201d Hinton\u2019s departure comes at a time of massive reorganization at his former company after massive layoffs. Last month, Google announced it was consolidating two of its most major AI teams together. Combining the Google Brain and DeepMind teams into one unit and also reorganized its AI leadership, with Brain lead Jeff Dean being moved to a chief scientist position while DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis is set to take control of all AI development. So far, the overt calls for stalling AI development have come from outside big tech. In March, hundreds of leading minds and researchers circulated an open letter demanding companies pause advanced AI systems. The letter criticized how major tech companies were locked in an \u201cout-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds\u201d that nobody could predict or control. Though that\u2019s not to say folks inside these companies don\u2019t have qualms. A recent report from Bloomberg claimed that people inside Google were especially concerned with the company\u2019s Bard AI. Staff said the chatbot was so bad it was constantly providing misinformation and lies to users. Want to know more about AI, chatbots, and the future of machine learning?

            "text": "A prominent artificial intelligence researcher known as the \u201cGodfather of AI\u201d has quit his job at Google \u2013 and says he now partly regrets his work advancing the burgeoning technology because of the risks it poses to society. Dr. Geoffrey Hinton is a renowned computer scientist who is widely credited with laying the AI groundwork that eventually led to the creation of popular chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and other advanced systems. The 75-year-old told the New York Times that he left Google so that he can speak openly about the risks of unrestrained AI development \u2013 including the spread of misinformation, upheaval in the jobs market and other, more nefarious possibilities. \u201cI console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn\u2019t done it, somebody else would have,\u201d Hinton said in an interview published on Monday. \u201cLook at how it was five years ago and how it is now,\u201d Hinton added later in the interview. \u201cTake the difference and propagate it forwards. That\u2019s scary.\u201d Hinton fears that AI will only become more dangerous in the future \u2014 with \u201cbad actors\u201d potentially exploiting advanced systems \u201cfor bad things\u201d that will be difficult to prevent. Hinton informed Google of his plans to resign last month and personally spoke last Thursday with company CEO Sundar Pichai, according to the report. The computer scientist did not reveal what he and Pichai discussed during the phone call. Google\u2019s chief scientist Jeff Dean defended the company\u2019s AI efforts. \u201cWe remain committed to a responsible approach to A.I. We\u2019re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly,\u201d Dean said in a statement. The Post has reached out to Google for further comment. Hinton is the latest of a growing number of experts who have warned that AI could cause significant harm without proper oversight and regulation. In March, Elon Musk and more than 1,000 other prominent figures in the AI sector called for a six-month pause in advanced AI development, citing its potential \u201cprofound risks to society and humanity.\u201d In the interview, Hinton expressed concern that artificial intelligence has already begun to outpace the human mind in some facets. He also cited concerns that the pace of AI development will increase as Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google and other tech giants race to lead the field \u2013 with potentially dangerous consequences. Hinton fears that advanced AI could eventually spiral out of control as systems gain the ability to create and run their own computer code \u2013 or even power weapons without human control. \u201cThe idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people \u2014 a few people believed that,\u201d Hinton added. \u201cBut most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.\u201d In a recent interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Pichai himself warned that AI would cause job losses for \u201cknowledge workers,\u201d such as writers, accountants, architects and software engineers. Pichai also detailed bizarre scenarios in which Google\u2019s AI programs have developed \u201cemergent properties\u201d \u2013 or learned unexpected skills in which they were not trained. Since 2013, Hinton had split his time between roles as a professor at the University of Toronto and as a Google engineering fellow. He had worked for the tech giant since Google acquired a startup he co-founded with two students, Alex Krishevsky and Ilya Sutskever. The trio developed a neural network that trained itself to identify common objects, such as cars or animals, by analyzing thousands of photos. Sutskever currently serves as chief scientist for OpenAI. In 2018, Hinton was a joint recipient of the Turing Award \u2013 often identified as the computing world\u2019s equivalent of the Nobel Prize \u2013 for work on neural networks that was described as \u201cmajor breakthroughs in artificial intelligence.\u201d A lengthy bio for Hinton on Google\u2019s website lauds his accomplishments \u2013 noting he \u201cmade major breakthroughs in deep learning that have revolutionized speech recognition and object classification.\u201d",

            "title": "As Europeans strike first to rein in AI, the US follows",
            "text": "A proposed set of rules by the European Union would, among other things. require makers of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT,to publicize any copyrighted material used by the technology platforms to create content of any kind. A new draft of European Parliament's legislation, a copy of which was attained by The Wall Street Journal, would allow the original creators of content used by generative AI applications to share in any profits that result. The European Union\u2019s \u201cArtificial Intelligence Act\u201d (AI Act) is the first of its kind by a western set of nations. The proposed legislation relies heavily on existing rules, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Digital Services Act, and the Digital Markets Act. The AI Act was originally proposed by the European Commission in April 2021. The bill\u2019s provisions also require that the large language models (LLMs) behind generative AI tech, such as the GPT-4, be designed with adequate safeguards against generating content that violates EU laws; that could include child pornography or, in some EU countries, denial of the Holocaust, according to The Washington Post. Violations of the AI Act could carry fines of up to 30 million euros or 6% of global profits, whichever is higher. \u201cFor a company like Microsoft, which is backing ChatGPT creator OpenAI, it could mean a fine of over $10 billion if found violating the rules,\u201d a Reuters report said. But the solution to keeping AI honest isn't easy, according to Avivah Litan, a vice president and distinguished analyst at Gartner Research. It\u2019s likely that LLM creators, such as San Fransisco-based OpenAI and others, will need to develop powerful LLMs to check that the ones trained initially have no copyrighted materials. Rules-based systems to filter out copyright materials are likely to be ineffective, Liten said. Meanwhile, the EU is busy refining its AI Act and taking a world-leading approach, Litan said, in creating rules that govern the fair and risk-managed use of AI going forward. Regulators should consider that LLMs are effectively operating as a black box, she said, and it's unlikely that the algorithms will provide organizations with the needed transparency to conduct the requisite privacy impact assessment. \"This must be addressed,\" Litan said. \"It\u2019s interesting to note that at one point the AI Act was going to exclude oversight of Generative AI models, but they were included later,\u201d Litan said \u201cRegulators generally want to move carefully and methodically so that they don\u2019t stifle innovation and so that they create long-lasting rules that help achieve the goals of protecting societies without being overly prescriptive in the means.\u201d On April 1, Italy became the first Western nation to ban further development of ChatGPT over privacy concerns; that occurred after the natural language processing app experienced a data breach involving user conversations and payment information. ChatGPT is the popular chatbot created by OpenAI and backed by billions of dollars from Microsoft. Earlier this month, the US and Chinese governments issued announcements related to regulations for AI development, something neither country has established to date. \u201cThe US and the EU are aligned in concepts when it comes to wanting to achieve trustworthy, transparent, and fair AI, but their approaches have been very different,\u201d Litan said. So far, the US has taken what Litan called a \u201cvery distributed approach to AI risk management,\u201d and it has yet to create new regulations or regulatory infrastructure. The US has focused on guidelines and an AI Risk Management framework. In January, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released the Artificial Intelligence Management Framework. In February, the White House issued an Executive Order directing federal agencies to ensure their use of AI advances equity and civil rights. The US Congress is considering the federal Algorithmic Accountability Act, which, if passed, would require employers to perform an impact assessment of any automated decision-making system that has a significant effect on an individual's access to, terms, or availability of employment. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), a branch of the US Department of Commerce, also issued a public request for comment on what policies would best hold AI systems accountable. States and municipalities are getting into the act, too, eyeing local restrictions on the use of AI-based bots to find, screen, interview, and hire job candidates because of privacy and bias issues. Some states have already put laws on the books. Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet have been in a race to bring generative AI chatbots to businesses and consumers. The most advanced generative AI engines can create their own content based on user prompts or input. So, for example, AI can be tasked with creating marketing or ad campaigns, writing essays, and generating realistic photo imagery and videos. Key to the EU\u2019s AI Act is a classification system that determines the level of risk an AI technology could pose to the health and safety or fundamental rights of a person. The framework includes four risk tiers: unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal, according to the World Economic Forum. Issues around generative AI platforms that regulators should be mindful of, according to Gartner, include: GPT models are not explainable: Model outputs are unpredictable; even the model vendors don\u2019t understand everything about how they work internally. Explainability or interpretability are prerequisites for model transparency. Inaccurate and fabricated answers: To mitigate the risks of inaccuracies and hallucinations, output generated by ChatGPT/GenAI should be assessed for accuracy, appropriateness, and actual usefulness before being accepted. Potential compromise of confidential data: No verifiable data governance and protection assurances that confidential enterprise information\u2013 for example, in the form of stored prompts \u2014 is not compromised. Model and output bias: Model developers and users must have policies or controls in place to detect biased outputs and deal with them consistent with company policy and any relevant legal requirements. Intellectual property (IP) and copyright risks: Model developers and users must scrutinize their output before further use to ensure it doesn\u2019t infringe on copyright or IP rights, and actively monitor changes in copyright laws that apply to ChatGPT/GenAI. Users are now on their own when it comes to filtering out copyrighted materials in ChatGPT outputs. Cyber and fraud risks: Systems should be hardened to try to ensure criminals are not able to use them for cyber and fraud attacks. Launched by OpenAI in November, ChatGPT immediately went viral and had 1 million users in just its first five days because of the sophisticated way it generates in-depth, human-like responses to queries. The ChatGPT website currently receives an estimated 1 billion monthly website visitors with an estimated 100 million active users, according to website test company Tooltester. Though the chatbot\u2019s responses may appear human-like, ChatGPT isn't sentient \u2014 it\u2019s a next-word prediction engine, according Dan Diasio, Ernst & Young global artificial intelligence consulting leader. With that in mind, he urged caution in its use. But as AI technology advances at breakneck speed, a more sophisticated algorithm is predicted to be on the horizon: artificial general intelligence, which could think for itself and become exponentially smarter over time. Earlier this month, an open letter from thousands of tech luminaries called for a halt to the development of generative AI technology out of concern that the ability to control it could be lost if it advances too far. The letter has garnered more than 27,000 signatories, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. The letter, published by the Future of Life Institute, called out San Francisco-based OpenAI Lab\u2019s recently announced GPT-4 algorithm in particular, saying the company should halt further development until oversight standards are in place. While AI has been around for decades, it has \u201creached new capacities fueled by computing power,\u201d Thierry Breton, the EU\u2019s Commissioner for Internal Market, said in a statement in 2021. The Artificial Intelligence Act, he said, was created to ensure that \u201cAI in Europe respects our values and rules, and harness the potential of AI for industrial use.\u201d",

            "title": "Xbox can't try to buy Activision again for 10 years after CMA ruling",
            "text": "Would Microsoft even bother trying again if it fails? (pic: Microsoft) Aside from a hefty termination fee, Microsoft\u2019s failure to buy Activision also means it can\u2019t try again for another decade. The Competition and Market Authority\u2019s (CMA) decision to block Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard has left a lot of people rattled and confused about what will happen next. It must be stressed that the deal isn\u2019t dead yet, as Microsoft has the right to appeal (which it\u2019s taken full advantage of) and it\u2019s entirely possible that it can get the ruling overturned. However, if things fall in favour of the CMA, then not only does Microsoft not get Activision Blizzard, but it can\u2019t try to buy it again for another 10 years. Buried within the CMA\u2019s full findings, is a \u2018prohibition remedy\u2019 that would prevent any kind of merger between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard for a set period of time. Normally, this would last for a whole decade, \u2018absent a change of circumstances.\u2019 That\u2019s vague enough that there might be some wriggle room but on the face of it, if Microsoft don\u2019t buy them now they can\u2019t try again until the space year 2033. As a reminder, should it fail to acquire Activision, Microsoft will need to pay the Call Of Duty company a termination fee of $3 billion (about \u00a32.4 billion). That\u2019s significantly less than the $69 billion it initially offered, but that still leaves Microsoft $3 billion out of pocket and nothing to show for it. Not to mention all the money it\u2019s spent on advertising the acquisition in newspapers and on the London Tube, which clearly didn\u2019t work on changing the CMA\u2019s mind. This risks becoming an old shame that will haunt Microsoft (pic: The Verge) You can find the full report from the CMA here (the relevant comments are on page 336), but ResetEra user Idas has put together a handy breakdown of key talking points, including further explanations behind the CMA\u2019s decision. Even if Microsoft is willing to wait a decade to try this all over again, there\u2019s no guarantee that Activision Blizzard will still be available. Another company could swoop in and buy it out in the meantime. The main reason the CMA blocked it is because it feels Microsoft has too much of a foothold within the cloud gaming space and believes owning Activision would only grant it more control, but that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be true of another suitor. While regulatory bodies worldwide have had a say on the deal, it\u2019s never been entirely clear whether Microsoft needs approval from every single one or not to finalise the acquisition. Had somewhere like Ukraine or Chile opted to block it, would it have caused as much of a commotion? The BBC\u2019s report suggests that, ultimately, Microsoft needs the go ahead from the UK\u2019s CMA, the European Commission, and the US\u2019s Federal Trade Commission. If it\u2019s those three that truly matter, that explains Microsoft\u2019s rather surly reaction to the CMA\u2019s decision. While the European Commission is predicted to approve the deal, the FTC has been Microsoft\u2019s other main roadblock. The FTC has not been shy about its scepticism of the deal, filing a lawsuit to block the acquisition near the end of 2022. The CMA\u2019s ruling makes the FTC\u2019s efforts much easier, so Microsoft now needs to work extra hard to appease both regulatory bodies.

            "title": "Generative AI Tools Like ChatGPT And Bard Heralding Generational Shift In Job Roles. Adapt Or Risk",
            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs), the technologies underpinning chatbots like ChatGPT, are creating cascading waves of emerging paradigm-shifting opportunities by redefining how we accumulate, organize, and disseminate knowledge-based information. Within a week of the ChatGPT launch, one million people had used it; within two months, the number soared to 100 million. The hockey stick adoption rate is being hailed as a game-changing Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) based productivity enhancement technology. Global competition amongst entrepreneurs and investors is hastily deploying Research and Development (R&D) resources to create cutting-edge AI-based productivity tools for a gamut of industries. Early users of the nascent ChatGPT are amazed at its ability to deliver work products at near-human levels of sophistication. We are just at the tip of the iceberg. The benefits and impact of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT on industries have only begun to occur, harbingering generational job role shifts. By consolidating the knowledge of the collective, these tools can unleash substantial productivity gains and accelerate growth. With the ability to produce content on command, these productivity enhancement tools are expected to deliver work products more quickly and efficiently than ever. The hybrid human/AI mix offers exciting possibilities for the future of work. According to a report by Goldman Sachs, Generative AI could raise global GDP by 7%. While ChatGPT has aroused a lot of excitement, it has also elicited ominous projections of potential job losses; subliminal messaging through biased responses; usage for malicious propaganda and harmful activities; taking over of the human race, and more. However, machines replacing jobs is an age-old fear. New technologies have historically created jobs to replace the ones obsoleted. Unlike prior technology innovations that have typically replaced unskilled labor, Generative AI can also undertake white-collar tasks. While there is no indication of disruption in job markets, it cannot be completely ruled out. By analyzing and interpreting vast repositories of data, AI can provide valuable assistance to individuals working in tech (coders, computer programmers, software engineers, data analysts, etc.), media (advertising, content creation, journalism, entertainment, etc.), legal (paralegals, legal assistants, etc.), market research, medical, education, gig economy/freelancing, liberal arts, STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics), gaming, finance, security/defense, and many more. With the help of Generative AI coding assistants, engineers can write code more efficiently, potentially paving the way for a future in which, rather than writing code themselves, software engineers will concentrate on instructing AI tools to write code. The primary focus could morph into qualifying work products produced by machines. These new working models will have applications across many fields. Using Generative AI tools to quickly create a first draft, after that, for a human to further correct, enhance, and deliver the final product in shorter task completion times, can significantly boost worker productivity across many job roles. Task-based programming, writing, and research dominate the freelance gig economy job market. The advent of productivity-enhancing Generative AI tools could have significant implications for the freelancing job market segment. In education, teachers can use Generative AI tools to create customized learning materials. AI tools can analyze data and patterns in healthcare to enhance diagnosis accuracy and help develop targeted drugs and personalized treatment plans. Similarly, in agriculture, the tools can assist farmers in making better decisions about crop planting and resource usage using weather and soil data, resulting in higher yields and operational efficiencies. In manufacturing, data analysis from sensors and machines can optimize production processes by identifying operational inefficiencies, leading to improved production throughputs, product quality, and lower costs. Microsoft MSFT , Google GOOG , and Amazon AMZN are investing billions in AI research to create cutting-edge tools for consumers and enterprises. Microsoft, a partner of OpenAI \u2013 the creator of ChatGPT, has already integrated AI into its MS 365 Suite, Bing search engine, and other product lines. Google is developing its Bard chatbot AI offering. Whereas Amazon is developing AI products for the enterprise market. Tesla TSLA CEO Elon Musk (an ex-founder of OpenAI) plans to launch a new AI start-up. Chinese tech giants Baidu BIDU and Alibaba have also launched their versions of AI technology. ChatGPT has attracted a surge of early adopters keen on keeping up with technological advancements and staying ahead of the curve. Employees at all levels within organizations are exploring various AI tools to automate time-consuming tasks or accelerate the delivery of their work products. Numerous companies have begun integrating ChatGPT-type tools into their product offerings, a few examples of which are as follows: Salesforce is integrating OpenAI\u2019s technology to create its Generative AI-based customer relationship management tools. It will also add a ChatGPT app to Slack for conversation summaries, research tools, and writing assistance. Bain & Company has integrated OpenAI\u2019s technologies, including ChatGPT, into its management systems, research, and other processes. Coca-Cola will be the first major consumer product company to use the system. Snap has launched a new AI feature called My AI on Snapchat+, which allows its 2.5 million subscribers to ask an AI chatbot for various prompts, such as dinner recipes and weekend trip plans. However, Snapchat has cautioned that the AI tool may be susceptible to providing biased, inaccurate, or misleading information. Quizlet, a website that offers educational tools, has introduced a new feature, Q-Chat, which utilizes OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT technology to provide one-on-one tutoring services. Instacart, the grocery delivery and pick-up service, will soon launch a new search engine feature called \u201cAsk Instacart,\u201d incorporating ChatGPT into its app. The feature will enable users to ask open-ended food questions and provide personalized answers from Instacart\u2019s vast database of 1.5 million products sold through 75,000 grocery stores. Shopify SHOP is launching a new shopping assistant feature that will use ChatGPT AI technology to help customers with search inquiries and provide personalized recommendations based on their requests. ChatGPT will analyze customer data to offer relevant and customized solutions, improving the overall user experience on the platform. Speak, a language learning app, has partnered with OpenAI. It uses its speech-to-text API Whisper for its new AI-speaking companion product to give users real-time feedback when learning a new language. IBM IBM chatbot, \u201cWatson Assistant,\u201d uses AI and natural language processing to provide customers personalized assistance and support. H&M chatbot \u201cH&M Home Stylist\u201d provides personalized recommendations based on the customer\u2019s preferences and budget. Sephora chatbot \u201cSephora Virtual Artist\u201d uses augmented reality and AI to provide personalized recommendations based on the customer\u2019s skin type, tone, and preferences. Uber UBER has integrated a chatbot, \u201cUber Bot,\u201d into their platform, enabling users to reserve a ride, monitor their trip status, and receive assistance with any concerns that may arise during their journey. Despite concerns, the benefits of LLM-based productivity enhancement tools like ChatGPT, in general, are enormous. These technologies can potentially revolutionize how we interact with and utilize technology to improve efficiency, productivity, and quality, thereby transforming a wide range of industries. As AI technology continues to evolve, improve, and be broadly deployed, it will be exciting to see how it elevates the living standards of societies worldwide. The rise of AI-based productivity enhancement tools is being hailed as the dawn of a new technological era. Staying current and adapting to the changing environment will mitigate obsolescence.",

            "text": "Think you\u2019re a great stock picker? Prove it! Enter my stock-picking contest, Dorfman\u2019s Three-Stock Derby. Contestants pick three stocks and the average gain on the three is their score. The winner gets a moment of fame, plus a $100 gift certificate to the restaurant of their choice. John Colodny, a hedge-fund manager and semi-retired electrical engineer from Coral Springs, Florida, won my 2022-2023 contest. First Place Last May, Colodny picked three exchange-traded funds issued by ProShares, each of which bet on energy prices to decline. The funds use leverage to increase their gains (or losses). His most successful bet was that the price of natural gas would decline. That bet achieved a 174% profit. His other two picks had a 3% gain and a 34% loss. Overall, he had a 47% gain. What led Colodny to believe that natural-gas prices would decline? \u201cIt was a combination of chart reading and climate issues,\u201d he says. Colodny\u2019s hedge fund is still in incubation: The only investors so far are his partner and himself. Colodny is the administrative officer. His partner, Geoff Liddy, does the stock picking. The fund does short-term trading. Its typical time horizon is \u201cminutes, not hours or days,\u201d Colodny said. He thinks the stock market will be stuck in a trading range between 3,800 and 4,200 on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index for most of this year. (The index stood at 4,169 as of April 28.) But he thinks it will \u201cbreak through 4,200 by the end of the year.\u201d His favorite personal investment at the moment is the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ( VOOG ). Its biggest holdings are Apple AAPL , Microsoft MSFT , Nvidia (NVDA) and Alphabet GOOGL . He sees the national debt as the market\u2019s biggest problem. He thinks major stock-market gains aren\u2019t likely \u201cuntil we get a handle on the deficit and federal spending.\u201d Second Place Ken Hagen, a dentist and real-estate developer in Omaha, Nebraska, grabbed second place with a 35% gain. He picked three Chinese stocks that trade in the U.S.\u2014Didi Global (DIDI), UP Fintech Holding Ltd. (TIGR) and DADA Nexus Ltd. (DADA). Two of the three had losses, but Didi Global rose 130%, giving Hagen a 35% gain overall. Didi is China\u2019s leading ride-hailing company. Hagen says he doesn\u2019t focus on the overall market, but looks for opportunities in individual stocks or exchange-traded funds. He is sweet on the semiconductor industry now. Third Place Taking the bronze medal was Gordon Faison, a flooring wholesaler from Virginia Beach, Virginia. His 28% return came mostly from Netflix NFLX , which surged 76% in the contest period. His other two picks, Moderna (MRNA) and Skyworks Solutions SWKS , had small gains. Faison expects the market to be \u201cdead flat until 2024.\u201d He dislikes the Biden administration, and is \u201cworried\u201d that Congress may be unable to compromise on the federal debt and spending. His favorite stocks are Pioneer Natural Resources PXD and Devon Energy DVN . Tough Year This year 37 contestants joined the Derby. Nineteen finished with losses, and 18 had gains. The average loss was about 1%. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index rose 7.6% during the contest period, including dividends. You Can Play To enter Dorfman\u2019s Three-Stock Derby, send me the six items below. 1. Your name 2. Address 3. Occupation 4. Email address 5. Phone numbers for work and home. 6. The three stocks you choose. You don\u2019t have to give your rationale but I like it if you do. Email me your entry at [email protected]. Or mail it to John Dorfman, Dorfman Value Investments, 101 Federal Street, Suite 1900, Boston MA 02110. Entries must be postmarked or time stamped by midnight May 21, 2023. The contest will run from May 21, 2023 to the market close on April 20, 2024. If you finish in the top three, I will want to interview you on short notice and possibly on a weekend, so the phone numbers are vital. You do not need to own the stocks you select, but it\u2019s fine if you do. Stocks must be traded in the U.S., but need not necessarily be U.S. companies. Short sales are permitted but not encouraged, since I have a separate short-selling contest. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are permitted. There is no fee to enter. The winner will receive a $100 gift certificate to the restaurant of her or his choice. Disclosure: I own Apple, Alphabet and Pioneer Natural Resources personally and for most of my clients. I own Moderna personally and for some clients. My wife, a portfolio manager at my firm, owns Microsoft and Nvidia personally and for clients.",

            "title": "Mark Wright \u2013 Excelling Among a Sea of Digital Marketing Platforms &amp; Businesses",
            "text": "In the last few decades, the world has witnessed a rise of digital platforms in various industries such as e-commerce, with Amazon and Alibaba leading the west and east hemispheres, social media, with Facebook and WeChat leading the west and east hemispheres, and computing with Microsoft Azure, Amazon\u2019s AWS, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud as the most well-known industry examples. This rapid rise in digital transformation has provided businesses with new and exponential growth opportunities. The rise of digital platforms is becoming an innovative trend that has been widely acknowledged by global corporations. However, digital platforms are being rapidly adopted in other industries such as banking, financial services, and insurance \u201cBFSI\u201d or global energy commodities trading. The tools used to create digital platforms can vary from a website, a registration service, a contact database, payment processors, to a shop, or a news feed. The selection of such tools depends on the business, and their purpose is to improve the user experience. Intending to bring a unique style to online marketing and to enhance customers\u2019 experiences, an individual named Mark Wright entered the fold of digital marketing. Mark, who was born in Australia, started his career as a sales manager for a large marketing agency, then went on to found and develop his own businesses has repeatedly been recognized for his company\u2019s high revenue growth and success. He has over nine years of sales experience in the digital, health, and fitness industries, but his first job was washing cars at his father\u2019s business. Beating all the odds, Wright appeared in BBC\u2019s Apprentice Series 10 in 2014, he then advanced to the show\u2019s finale, where he competed against Bianca Miller for a \u00a3250,000 business investment from Lord Sugar. It was his unique approach to online marketing for business development that made him the winner of BBC Apprentice 2014. Following his success on the show, Mark formed a partnership with Lord Sugar and founded and developed Climb Online, one of the UK\u2019s fastest-growing digital marketing agencies. In its first year of operation, the company made a staggering \u00a31.7 million, securing contracts with over 200 customers from the UK and abroad. Wright also began a digital advertising course in collaboration with E-Careers Limited in 2016. The goal of Climb Academy Level 1: Introduction to Digital Marketing is to educate the general public, teach them how to manage simple campaigns, and facilitate the next generation by providing them with access to digital marketing skills. Climb Online is renowned for its disruptive approach to digital marketing, working with household brands to scale growth and generate profit. It is the most successful business founded by an Apprentice winner to date. Wright\u2019s experience in establishing and growing a multi-million-pound-turnover digital empire has led him to seek out and invest in additional businesses such as property investment, web development, and public relations sectors, where he has dedicated his time to implementing strategies that have replicated admirable levels of success. Undoubtedly, Climb Online proved to be a huge success. Wright founded the digital marketing agency and grew it to a team of 130 people. Their company also worked with some of the world\u2019s largest corporations, including Emirates and TikTok. In June 2019, Wright launched his own annual UK business conference, CLIMBCON, which welcomed hundreds of business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs to learn from proven business leaders such as Lord Sugar and Piers Morgan. Other than his business ventures, Wright contributes articles and opinions to a variety of publications, including small businesses, startups, and BM magazine. He has also been a keynote speaker at conferences such as the 10X UK conference, The Business Show, Introbiz, Event Buyers Live, Digital Print for Brand Success Conference, and Business Revival Series, among others. Wright\u2019s proven skill and capability in business have earned him credentials as an ambitious influencer on lead generation, profitability, and growth, and his journey to success has inspired entrepreneurs globally, who regularly attend his public speaking engagements and motivational talks both in the UK and abroad. It was Wright\u2019s continuous determination that reserved his name in the Forbes 30 under 30 list (Europe) in January 2017 for his impact on and dedication to the business sector, and he has since won a slew of business accolades, including Entrepreneur\u2019s Team of the Year at 2018, Great British Entrepreneur Awards, and Entrepreneur of the Year at the 2018 UK Business Awards.",

In 2012, Hinton and two of his graduate students at the University of Toronto created technology that became the intellectual foundation for the AI systems that the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies believe is a key to their future. On Monday, however, he officially joined a growing chorus of critics who say those companies are racing toward danger with their aggressive campaign to create products based on generative artificial intelligence, the technology that powers popular chatbots like ChatGPT. Hinton said he has quit his job at Google, where he has worked for more than decade and became one of the most respected voices in the field, so he can freely speak out about the risks of AI. A part of him, he said, now regrets his life\u2019s work. \u201cI console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn\u2019t done it, somebody else would have,\u201d Hinton said during an interview last week at his home in Toronto, a short walk from where he and his students made their breakthrough. \u201cIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it (AI) for bad things,\u201d Hinton said. \u00a92023 The New York Times News Service Also Read Google Bard: What we know so far about generative AI chatbot in the works Google may lose search on Samsung devices to Microsoft Bing: Report Google's move to make app makers use its new billing system faces backlash More than crypto, I am interested in artificial intelligence: Elon Musk Italy orders OpenAI to stop processing users' data else face fine IMF Chief Kristalina says rising rates exposed banking vulnerabilities Social media giant Meta aims to raise $7 bn through corporate bond sale General Motors lays off several hundred full-time contract workers May Day Protest: World's workers rally, France sees pension anger Elon Musk cuts down parental leaves of Twitter employees: Report Topics : Artificial intelligence Google First Published: May 01 2023 | 10:26 PM IST Latest News View More In this section All Sebi imposes Rs 10 lakh fine on Angel Broking for flouting regulatory norms 3 min read Mobikwik turns profitable in March quarter, expects to double revenue 2 min read Hero MotoCorp's sales decline by 5% YoY to 396,107 units in April 1 min read IMF Chief Kristalina says rising rates exposed banking vulnerabilities 3 min read Premium The story, the actor and the budget have to work for theatres: Shiv Chanana 4 min read Most Popular View More Read Shared Commented JPMorgan to acquire First Republic Bank after seizure by regulator 2 min read Premium ESMA row: EU banks likely to turn Indian entities into subsidiaries 3 min read LIVE: National Capital reports 259 fresh cases and 2 deaths in last 24 hrs 3 min read SoftBank Group's chip maker Arm registers for blockbuster US IPO 2 min read US manufacturing sector contracts for sixth straight month in April 2 min read BROWSE STOCK COMPANIES TRENDING NOW TOP SEARCHED COMPANIES FROM BS WEBSITEHomeCompaniesMarketsOpinionIndia NewsTechnologyPersonal FinanceIncome Tax CalculatorLatest NewsEducationPartner ContentSpecialsToday's PaperAuthor ABOUT USAbout UsCode of ConductTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDisclaimerInvestor CommunicationList of our GST registration number SUPPORT & CONTACTPartner with UsCareersAdvertise with UsContact UsFeedbackBrowser SupportSitemap READER CENTREE-PaperMy PagePortfolioRegistrationSubscribeCustom PaymentDelete My Account BS PRODUCTSBS HindiB2B ConnectiPhoneBS Apps EVENTBudgetBudget with BSAssembly Elections 2023 SPORTSIPL 2023Cricket News Copyrights \u00a9 2023 Business Standard Private Ltd.

            "text": "I\u2019ve talked with ChatGPT many times now, and it occasionally lapses into a state of senility in which it doesn\u2019t remember who it is or what we\u2019re talking about. I will ask it something like, \u201cHey, ChatGPT, how do you think AI chatbots like yourself will impact the publishing industry in the years to come?\u201d and it starts yammering on about how it \u201cdoesn\u2019t know anything about a ChatGPT.\u201d Sorta like a cross between a mafioso pleading the fifth and your geriatric uncle trying to remember whether he killed a guy in Korea or not, ChatGPT occasionally just can\u2019t bring itself to answer your question. Algorithm malfunction or cagey evasiveness? You decide... Yessss...turns out, ChatGPT can be quite NSFW when it wants to be. In a bout of inspired depravity, I once instructed it to write me an erotic story involving an Octopus and it dutifully obliged. Then there\u2019s Twitch streamer Jordan Raskopoulos, who recently prompted the chatbot to write a dirty tale about Scooby Doo and got more than he bargained for. Let\u2019s face it: the advent of robot smut is officially here and we are all really happy about it. Right, guys? Right? If this robot is really good at performing absolutely mission critical tasks like writing pervy stories, it apparently isn\u2019t so great at lesser tasks, like computer coding. While there was initially some hubbub about the chatbot\u2019s abilities to do a software programmer\u2019s work for them, it was swiftly revealed that ChatGPT had a problem with inserting gibberish into codebases. To head off a swarm of coding BS, software site Stack Overflow decided to ban ChatGPT from its digital premises for the foreseeable future: \u201cOverall, because the average rate of getting correct answers from ChatGPT is too low, the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking and looking for correct answers,\u201d admins wrote. Sounds fair! Concerns are high when it comes to how this weirdly articulate chatbot will impact and/or disrupt academia. Will ChatGPT kill the college essay? Will it make teachers irrelevant? More importantly, will it lead to a tsunami of cheating from high school slackers who just want a robot to write their history essay for them already? The New York City Department of Education certainly seems to think so, because it just banned ChatGPT on all school networks and devices. No word yet on whether other cities plan to follow suit. Turns out one thing robots are good at is writing stories about robots. We actually got it to write an entire science fiction story for us, though we had to try and retry prompts to make it coherent. Was the story good? Ehhhh...well, not exactly. But, tbh, I\u2019ve read worse! ChatGPT crossed the 100-million mark of monthly active users in early February 2023, despite only launching in November of the previous year, according to an analysis from the bank UBS. It\u2019s among the fastest-growing applications in history, with roughly 13 million unique visitors daily. Microsoft is investing some $10 billion in OpenAI to forge a partnership with the fledgling AI pioneer (Google is very worried). To that end, the office software giant rolled out a premium version of its office chat software Teams in early February 2023, which will generate meeting notes and to-do lists, among other things. It\u2019ll cost $7 per user until the price ramps up to $10 a head in July 2023.",

            "text": "Renowned AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton has quit his job at Google to voice his concerns about the risks associated with generative AI, the technology behind popular chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard. The New York Times reports that Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, has resigned from his position at Google in order to express his concerns about the potential dangers of generative AI technology. In a recent in-depth interview, Dr. Hinton expressed regret over his life\u2019s work, which formed the basis for the AI systems used by significant tech companies. He stated, \u201cI console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn\u2019t done it, somebody else would have.\u201d Industry leaders believe that generative AI could result in important advances in a variety of industries, including drug research and education, but there is growing concern about the risks that this technology might present. \u201cIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,\u201d Dr. Hinton said. He emphasized the potential for generative AI to contribute to the spread of misinformation, displace jobs, and even threaten humanity in the long term. Hinton, who is frequently referred to as \u201cthe Godfather of AI,\u201d has had a distinguished career in the field that has spanned many years. His early research on neural networks, which dates back to the 1970s, eventually resulted in a ground-breaking development in 2012, when he and his graduate students at the University of Toronto created systems that were capable of deciphering and identifying objects in tens of thousands of photos. This accomplishment paved the way for cutting-edge AI innovations including chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard. However, Hinton thinks that as AI systems have grown more powerful, so have the risks associated with them. \u201cLook at how it was five years ago and how it is now,\u201d he said. \u201cTake the difference and propagate it forwards. That\u2019s scary.\u201d He points to the intensifying rivalry between Google and Microsoft as a reason it might be impossible to stop the creation and application of potentially harmful AI technology. Dr. Hinton\u2019s top concern is the possibility that the internet will be overrun with false information, making it challenging for the average person to distinguish between fact and fiction. \u201cMy fear is that the internet will be inundated with false photos, videos, and text, and the average person will not be able to know what is true anymore,\u201d he explained. Hinton is also concerned about how AI will affect the job market, especially for positions requiring repetitive work like paralegals, personal assistants, and translators. \u201cIt takes away the drudge work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might take away more than that.\u201d Hinton worries about the long-term development of autonomous weapons and the potential for AI to surpass human intelligence. \u201cThe idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people \u2014 a few people believed that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.\u201d Read more at the New York Times here.

            "title": "With Windows 10 Going Away, Time To Get Serious About Windows 11 - WorldNewsEra",
            "text": "Well, it\u2019s official: Microsoft has announced that Windows 10 22H2 will be the last released version of Windows 10. Though Windows 10 will officially be supported until October 2025, businesses will need to make a lot of budgetary decisions between now and then. The hardware mandates of Windows 11 mean many firms will be squeezing out every last minute of support from their Windows 10 investment. Current estimates are that nearly 70% of Windows users still deploy Windows 10, and I know that many will be betting (and hoping) that Microsoft provides some sort of lifeline to extend our use of Windows 10 \u2014 much as the company did with Windows 7. While many argue that hardware purchased in the last several years can easily support Windows 11, the reality is that some of it just won\u2019t cut it. With just over two years to go, many users might want to review their needs, deployment methods, and even whether we\u2019re going to continue using traditional desktops. There are other issues with Windows 11, one brought about by Microsoft when it changed in the menu and control systems, the other coming from the gamer and IT professional communities. When I roll out Windows 11 to someone, invariably the first thing they ask is, \u201cWhere did cut and paste go?\u201d The biggest change in the Windows 10 user Interface involved the right-mouse-click options. Cut and paste are still there, in plain sight \u2014 if you\u2019re used to seeing the icons that stand for cut and paste. Once users realize where those commands are located, they make the migration accordingly. The shift was intentional by Microsoft. But clearly there wasn\u2019t a complete break from legacy menu systems and control panels. Microsoft, after all, realizes that many tools still hook into the Control panel. Thus, while one camp wants Microsoft to rip out every trace of the old UI and become modern, the reality is that Microsoft knows it has to go slow with any transition; too many of us build integrations into legacy controls. This led to the creation of third-party tools to tweak the menu system. But it also triggered an unwelcome side effect: more bugs in the operating system. As Raymond Chen points out, Microsoft saw issues in the telemetry data it collects and released a warning in the Windows 11 patching information. After the installation of KB5023774 or later updates, Windows devices with some third-party UI customization apps might not start up. (ExplorerPatcher and StartAllBack, in particular, were affected.) Windows 11\u2019s reputation has also been affected by the gamer community and by more experienced Windows users. Gamers often push operating systems with various overclocking tweaks or tools to increase performance \u2014 tools that often rely on unapproved adjustments. Show me a thread on reddit that discusses an issue with Windows 11 performance after the installation of the latest monthly updates, I\u2019ll show you someone who runs various games on the platform. (It\u2019s rarely an IT admin complaining about thousands of business desktops.) Windows 11\u2019s higher security requirements don\u2019t always play well with some games. I\u2019ve recently seen specific versions of Windows designed to cater to the gaming community and disable Windows updates and Windows Defender. While users will now be warned when they disable these core parts of the operating system, this is clearly a situation where people choose to disable security updates because they think they create problems. IT pros also have affected the reputation of Windows 11 because they\u2019ve been slow to upgrade. It\u2019s understandable: Windows 11 is a disruptive platform, from its mandatory hardware requirements to its emphasis on security, from its changes to the menu system to those right-mouse-click changes. Many businesses, including mine, have slowed the upgrade process. Like many firms, we will have to buy our way into the move to Windows 11 instead of simply deploying a feature release. The announcement that 22H2 will be the last feature release for Windows 10 should now allow companies to shift resources from feature release management to Windows 11 deployments. This is a good time for businesses to reevaluate deployment methodologies, management tools and long-term plans. Should your next server be a physical server? Should your next software purchase envision a cloud deployment? Should you use Intune to manage systems rather than Windows Software Update Services? Should you move to Autopilot for your deployment needs? You now have a bit more than two years to figure out what changes you need to make. The clock is ticking.",

            "title": "Microsoft Unveils New Xbox Home Screen",
            "text": "Microsoft is set to launch a new version of the Xbox Home experience, and testers in the Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha rings will be able to preview the updated design this week. The company has taken into consideration the feedback it has received from users to make changes to the top of the Home screen. The redesign comes after Microsoft received feedback from users that the changes to the top of Home felt crowded and didn\u2019t leave enough space for them to enjoy their background. The team at Xbox took this feedback to heart and designed hundreds of options, refined them with prototypes, and user-tested them in their research labs until they found a design that balances accessibility, function and the needs of the community. One of the standout features of the new design is the introduction of a quick-access menu at the very top of the Home screen. This menu provides easy navigation to your library, the Microsoft Store, Xbox Game Pass, search, and settings, making it easier for gamers to find what they\u2019re looking for quickly and efficiently. To create more space for users to enjoy their backgrounds, the size of some tiles has been reduced and moved to the bottom of the screen. This simplifies the layout and allows for more room to display your chosen background. Additionally, a responsive game art feature has been added to update the default background and show off the beautiful art associated with each title when you hover over the tiles. In addition to these changes, Microsoft has also updated the tile that opens \u201cMy games & apps\u201d to let you know when there\u2019s something new or needs your attention. As with any new release, the experience is not final, and users may see updates either from their library or the Microsoft Store. However, the team at Xbox is excited to hear what users think of the new design and hopes that it will enhance their overall gaming experience. Overall, Microsoft\u2019s new Xbox Home experience promises to provide an easier and more intuitive navigation experience, while also creating more space for users to enjoy their chosen background and showcase beautiful game art. With the rollout to testers beginning this week, gamers can look forward to an improved gaming experience in the near future.",

            "title": "TripAdvisor Lawsuit Highlights Companies Moving To Nevada From Delaware - WorldNewsEra",
            "text": "The suit alleges that Tripadvisor\u2019s majority shareholder, Gregory Maffei, is planning to use his supervoting stock holdings at shareholder meetings planned for June 6 to push through the move. Maffei, CFO at Oracle ORCL, +0.41% and then Microsoft MSFT, -0.48% in the 1990s and 2000s, is chairman and chief executive of Liberty Media, which is parent to SiriusXM SIRI, -0.79% and Live Nation Entertainment LYV, +0.96%. He is also chairman and CEO of Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings Inc. LTRPA, +4.24%, which owns a controlling stake in Tripadvisor Inc. Tripadvisor, whose headquarters are in suburban Boston, declined to comment on the litigation. Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, based in the Denver area, did not respond to a request for comment. The incorporation move will make it harder for minority shareholders to hold Tripadvisor and its parent liable if they breach their fiduciary duties, the suit argues. That\u2019s because Nevada has become a \u201cno-liability corporate safe haven,\u201d following legislative actions that have eliminated protections for shareholders by freeing directors and officers from liability arising from the operation and supervision of their companies, the suit alleges. \u201cAs prominent corporate-law professor Ann Lipton recently observed, \u2018I tell my students, Nevada is where you incorporate if you want to do frauds,\u2019 \u201d the suit states. Nevada\u2019s corporate code has always been somewhat loose but has gotten even more so in recent years, Lipton, who is associate dean for faculty research at Tulane University in New Orleans and a securities and corporate litigator, told MarketWatch. A recent amendment to the law was interpreted by the Nevada\u2019s state supreme court as relieving officers and directors of even more potential liability, she said. TripAdvisor and Liberty TripAdvisor\u2019s recently published proxy statements lay out the rationale for reincorporating in Nevada. \u201cThe redomestication will provide potentially greater protection from unmeritorious litigation for directors and officers of the company,\u201d says Tripadvisor in its April 10 proxy statement. The move would further \u201cresult in the elimination of any liability of an officer or director for a breach of the duty of loyalty unless arising from intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law,\u201d it continues. Liberty TripAdvisor used similar language in its April 21 proxy: \u201cThe conversion into a Nevada corporation may help us attract and retain qualified management by reducing the risk of lawsuits being filed against us and our directors and officers. We believe that, for the reasons described below, Nevada law generally provides greater protection against liability for our directors, officers and the company than Delaware law.\u201d In both proxies, the boards recommend that shareholders vote in favor of the resolution and say it would also save them $250,000 a year in fees paid in Delaware. Nevada charges an annual business license fee of just $500 and a filing fee that is currently about $1,225, according to the Tripadvisor proxy. The Delaware fees, too, are modest, as compared with Tripadvisor\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue of $354 million, which was up 47% from $241 million in the year-earlier period and ahead of the FactSet consensus of $344.2 million. The shareholder suit argues that shareholders are effectively cut out of any say in the plan, which they say was created without the hiring of a special committee or any other evaluation process. The parent company\u2019s proxy acknowledges that its board and shareholders interests may not align. \u201cThese interests may present such persons with actual or potential conflicts of interest. Our Board of Directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in reaching the decision to approve the plan of conversion and the conversion and recommend that our stockholders vote in favor of the conversion proposal,\u201d it says. Maffei owns more than 43% of voting rights in Liberty TripAdvisor, sufficient to exercise control over the vote. And the parent company controls nearly all voting rights at Tripadvisor, \u201cso the stockholder votes are a fait accompli,\u201d according to the suit. Maffei, meanwhile, has been a defendant in a series of actions cited in the suit in which he engaged in \u201cconflicted transactions favoring his own interests at the expense of public stockholders.\u201d Those actions have resulted in settlements that run to more than $200 million. The Tripadvisor proxy also discloses that \u201cthe redomestication is expected to provide corporate flexibility in connection with certain corporate transactions,\u201d without offering further details. \u201cAt bottom, the conversions are self-interested transactions aimed to benefit the companies\u2019 directors, officers, and controlling stockholder to the clear detriment of minority public stockholders,\u201d says the suit. Benjamin Edwards, associate professor of law at the William S. Boyd School of Law the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said Delaware is the clear leader in state incorporation law and has been for more than 100 years. \u201cIt has a very deep body of case law, a lot of precedent and in the business world, it\u2019s a common tongue that almost everybody understands.\u201d Delaware rules are all imposed by the courts, while Nevada has a statutory business code put in place by the state legislature. Both states prohibit rank misconduct, but the nuance lies in the balance sought between allowing what could be viewed as meddlesome, low-value suits to be filed that destroy value for all shareholders, and making it too hard for investors to sue, which would deter some from investing in a company in the first place. Recent research conducted by law professor Ofer Eldar of Duke University found that relatively lax corporate law can benefit some shareholders. That\u2019s especially true of those who own stakes in smaller companies, UNLV\u2019s Edwards noted. \u201cA possible explanation is that Nevada\u2019s pro-managerial laws reduce the likelihood of takeovers and litigation, thereby benefiting a segment of small firms for which the costs of corporate governance may outweigh the benefits,\u201d Eldar wrote. A number of companies have recently made the move to Nevada from Delaware, where more than 60% of the Fortune 500 are incorporated, earning Wilmington, Del., the nickname Corporate Capital of the World. These include Elon Musk\u2013era Twitter, which Musk recently placed in his shell company called X, which is domiciled in Nevada. For more: \u2018X\u2019 marks the spot where Elon Musk has buried Twitter Inc. Other companies that have asked shareholders to approve a move to Nevada from Delaware in recent years include Recruiter.com RCRT, -4.31%, FG Financial Group Inc. FGF, +4.17%, Predictive Oncology Inc. POAI, -3.17%, Chembio Diagnostics Inc. and Surge Components Inc. SPRS, -4.64%, according to SEC filings. So, how is the Delaware court likely to respond to the Tripadvisor suit? \u201cIt certainly puts Delaware in an awkward position, and it\u2019s delicate politically,\u201d said Lipton of Tulane. \u201cIt\u2019s weird for one state to say, \u2018Your state is so bad, we should leave.\u2019 The legal principles are well-established, but it hasn\u2019t come up in this context.\u201d UNLV\u2019s Edwards agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely valid for Delaware to set its own rules for when companies can leave and what procedures and processes they have to use,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I would not expect Delaware to turn into the Hotel California, where you can check in, but you can never leave.\u201d The law firms bringing the suit sum it up as follows: \u201cThe core question in this case is whether fiduciaries of a Delaware corporation \u2014 still bound by Delaware law and the duty of loyalty \u2014 can use their control over the corporation to force the company and its minority investors to give up all of Delaware law\u2019s protections, with the sole purpose being to insulate the conflicted controller and insiders from accountability. \u201cThe answer to that question is no.\u201d Tripadvisor\u2019s stock is up 1.5% to date in 2023, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.02% has gained 8.9%.",

            "title": "\u2018Godfather of AI\u2019 Leaves Google to Save Us From AI",
            "text": "Geoffrey Hinton, an artificial intelligence pioneer known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" resigned from his position at Google so that he could openly express his concerns about how A.I. could cause significant harm to the world. Hinton admitted in a New York Times interview that he now partly regrets his life's work. Despite the beneficial uses of A.I., Hinton fears that the technology could be used irresponsibly, unleashing unintended consequences. Hinton is worried that competition between tech giants like Google and Microsoft to create the most advanced A.I. will result in a global race that will not stop without some form of worldwide regulation. However, he was also emphatic in pointing out that he thought that Google has acted responsibly in its research: Hinton is known for popularizing the theoretical development of neural networks in 1986 and for creating one capable of recognizing images in 2012. His work was crucial to the development of current generative art models like Stable Diffusion and MidJourney, and laid the groundwork for OpenAI's upcoming efforts to make GPT-4 capable of interacting with images. His potentially belated move has many comparing him to J. Robert Oppenheimer, a physics professor credited with creating the atomic bomb. The Risks of AI One of the immediate problems Hinton highlights is the proliferation of fake images, videos, and text online, which could make the truth increasingly difficult to discern for the average person. As generative A.I. continues to improve, creators of fake and manipulative content could use these tools to deceive and confuse people. Hinton is also concerned about how A.I. could affect jobs in the future. While chatbots like ChatGPT currently complement human workers, they could ultimately replace those who handle routine tasks, such as personal assistants, accountants, and translators. Although AI may alleviate some monotonous work, it could also eliminate more jobs than anticipated, disrupting social balance. In the long term, Hinton fears that future versions of the technology pose a threat to humanity due to the unexpected behavior they may learn from the large volumes of data they analyze. This becomes a problem when A.I. systems are allowed to generate and execute their own code. This long-term view also gained particular relevance when other key figures in the A.I. field began to warn about the possibility of a \"foom\" scenario\u2014in which AI far outpaces human intelligence\u2014and the impact it could have on societal development. Hinton is just one of thousands of tech leaders and researchers alarmed by the exponential advancement of AI developments for various fields (from erotic chats to medical diagnostics). Last month, an open letter gained popularity in which leaders called for a pause in AI development until adequate controls are established. Hinton did not sign it. The evolution of Hinton's position on A.I. reflects a growing awareness of the risks and challenges associated with rapidly evolving technology. For Hinton, resigning from his life's work was important to prevent a scenario that he says seems to be getting closer every day. \"Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now,\" he told The New York Times. \"Take the difference and propagate it forwards. That's scary.\"",

            "text": "From 1987 to 2012, Kevin Mallory worked in a variety of intelligence jobs, including as a Central Intelligence Agency case officer recruiting spies. In February, 2017, Mallory found himself out of work, behind on his mortgage and $200,000 in debt when he received a message on LinkedIn from one Richard Yang, inviting him to become a part of his network. Mallory\u2019s training led him to suspect that Yang was likely a Chinese spy, and court records show that Mallory replied, \u201cI\u2019m open to whatever. I\u2019ve got to \u2014 you know \u2014 pay the bills.\u201d Richard Yang then passed Mallory to Michael Yang, likely a member of the Shanghai bureau of the Ministry of State Security (MSS, \u56fd\u5b89\u90e8 gu\u00f3\u2019\u0101n b\u00f9), China\u2019s main civilian intelligence agency. (Their Chinese names could not be confirmed.) The Yangs told Mallory they were looking for an expert on foreign affairs to help them with research for the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. The \u201cresearch\u201d they asked him for turned out to be classified information. Although the U.S. is unsure how much spying Mallory did for the MSS, in 2019, he was sentenced by the Virginia Eastern District Court to two decades behind bars, a term he is now serving at the U.S. Penitentiary in Canaan, PA. In 2018, William Evanina, then America\u2019s top spycatcher, said China was running a \u201csuper aggressive\u201d effort on LinkedIn to recruit spies. Evanina, then the director of the U.S. Counterintelligence and Security Center, told Reuters that LinkedIn\u2019s website was the \u201cultimate playground for collection\u201d of intelligence because government officials frequently post about their security clearance status, making it easy for Beijing\u2019s spooks to spot targets. At the time of the Mallory case, LinkedIn Vice President of Trust and Safety Paul Rockwell said that the company was talking with U.S. law enforcement and doing \u201ceverything we can to identify and stop this activity.\u201d The U.S. is not the only nation being targeted on LinkedIn. A French report claimed that Chinese spooks approached 4,000 members of the French government and business elite on LinkedIn. German security services concluded that at least 10,000 German citizens were contacted by Chinese spies on the social network, warning the number was probably a significant undercount. In 2021, the British government warned that spies had tried to contact more than 10,000 U.K. nationals to lure them to spy. This last report did not point the finger at China, but the recruitment efforts sounded similar to those in the U.S., France, and Germany. LinkedIn declined to comment for this article. America\u2019s spring season of paranoia In the spring of 2023, Chinese spying is having a moment thanks to a series of events that have further exposed American fears about the rising power across the Pacific. In March, the world tracked a Chinese spy balloon floating across the width of the U.S. and watched as a bipartisan committee in Congress grilled TikTok\u2019s CEO about the ways the Chinese social media platform famous for teenage dance videos might be threatening American Democracy. Then, in April, a national security leak by a young Massachusetts Air National Guardsman touched on China, amplifying fear of Chinese spying and once again making Beijing into a political football for U.S. policymakers heading into an election season. Also in April, New York lawmakers exposed that Chinese police had set up an office in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown from which they ran intimidation campaigns against ethnic Chinese who hold views divergent from those of the Chinese Communist Party. On April 26, Charles Lieber, the former Harvard chemist, was sentenced by a court in Boston for lying about his ties to China in a case of economic espionage. As the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties jockey for position as inflation soars and Russia wages war in Ukraine, Chinese infiltration of the U.S. completed the American fear sandwich best described in a comment by Florida Republican Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, who called TikTok \u201cA Chinese Communist Party balloon in everybody\u2019s home.\u201d Lawmakers across the country in another red state, Montana \u2014 where the Chinese spy balloon was first spotted in U.S. airspace \u2014 quickly became the first to approve a full ban of TikTok. Yang Zeyi, a journalist at MIT Technology Review who works on issues related to Chinese tech, wonders about America\u2019s reaction to TikTok in the current political climate. \u201cNationalism is a part of it,\u201d said Yang, who grew up in Wuhan before studying at Columbia University in New York. \u201cTiktok is not significantly different from other social media apps, according to experts. It is under attack because it is a Chinese company, probably. They have privacy protection issues, but these are the same that that all social media have.\u201d Full of Hot Air American politicians and the spooks meant to guard them, and all U.S. citizens, warn that TikTok is a spy threat, but offer little evidence to back their claim. Researchers at the Citizen Lab, an independent outfit that studies internet openness and security at the University of Toronto, did an analysis of TikTok and Douyin, a sister app for China\u2019s intranet. Their 2021 study found no evidence that the apps, both created by Beijing-based parent company ByteDance, collected contact lists, recorded photos, videos, or audio, or sent geolocation data to anybody (let alone the Chinese Communist Party) without user permission. If espionage in social media is such a threat, why are U.S. politicians not also clamoring to ban LinkedIn, where, unlike on TikTok, there appears to be ample evidence of Chinese agents fishing for classified information? \u201cThe potential for economic espionage is bigger for LinkedIn,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington, D.C. think tank. \u201cIt is a way to connect with business people, people involved with technology. TikTok is not.\u201d When The China Project asked if the average American should be worried about TikTok, Bruce Schneier, Harvard expert on cybersecurity, emphasized that TikTok was not all that different from American internet companies. \u201cNah, Facebook and Google are probably worse. We built an internet with surveillance at its core. That is what the internet does. We cannot just say, \u2018They can\u2019t do that.\u2019 Everybody spies.\u201d Sure. Spies are gonna spy, but cooler heads say the U.S. has less reason to fear than the current Balloongate-TikTok bomb threat suggests. The MSS and other Chinese spy agencies are collecting vast amounts of secret data, but their spies are sloppy. With good counterintelligence the China threat can be managed. China\u2019s spies are Keystone Cops Ed Peng (\u5f6d\u96ea\u83ef P\u00e9ng Xu\u011bhu\u00e1) was typical of the threat posed. He was an ethnic Chinese who was very bad at spying. In March 2015, Peng, a naturalized U.S. citizen, began working for the MSS as a cut-out, spy jargon for a go-between who carries money and messages between an intelligence officer and his or her asset. For four years, Peng\u2019s spying typically involved him booking a hotel room in the San Francisco Bay Area or Columbus, GA, leaving $20,000 in a drawer in the room, then disappearing after having asked the desk to let a friend into the room. When Peng returned, the friend had come and gone, taking the $20,000 and leaving a secure digital memory card full of what Peng thought were U.S. military secrets. Peng would then jet off to China, taking the SD card to his MSS handlers. What neither Peng nor intelligence officers at the MSS realized was that, for four years, they were being fooled by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose agents had sent Peng the \u201cfriend,\u201d who was really a double agent, slipping Peng and his MSS contacts what intelligence specialists call chicken feed, worthless secrets they are willing to give away to fool their mark into returning for more. Peng also never noticed that he was being followed by the FBI, whose agents filmed him in each of his hotel rooms. Peng didn\u2019t practice even basic tradecraft, the sneaky techniques of intelligence gathering and evasion that spies use to make sure that they are not caught spying. More surprising was that MSS officers reading through the SD cards never realized that they were being strung along by the FBI. In the realm of human intelligence, or humint, China\u2019s spies are more Keystone Cops than Jason Bournes. \u201cMSS officers used to not be very well regarded by intelligence officials in other countries, including the U.S., France, Britain and Canada,\u201d James Olson, a former CIA officer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen overly sophisticated tradecraft from Chinese spies,\u201d Olson said, adding the caution that their skills may be improving and he still considers China \u201cthe greatest counter espionage threat\u201d in the world. In his book, Chinese Espionage: Strategies and Tactics, Nicholas Eftimiades, another ex-CIA officer, collected 595 cases of known Chinese espionage. In his database, Eftimiades found that 80 percent of those caught spying for China are ethnically Chinese and 90 percent are men. Many of the cases he looked at were carried out by low-level operatives like Peng. Two-hundred-eighteen, or 37%, showed no tradecraft. Of the 96 cases involving MSS officers \u2014 China\u2019s top spies \u2014 25% were caught showing no use of tradecraft, and another 14% used only limited tradecraft, a fact Eftimiades called \u201castounding.\u201d By comparison, \u201cthe tradecraft of [Russian] KGB, [East German] Stasi and CIA officers was generally good,\u201d Paul Maddrell, editor of The Image of the Enemy: Intelligence Analysis of Adversaries Since 1945, told The China Project. \u201cI know of no case when they showed little or no tradecraft.\u201d Another case of a bumbling Chinese spook with little training is Christine Fang, who posed as a college student but actually was sent to California by the MSS to spy on politicians. When Fang met out in the open with her handler, an MSS officer working undercover in the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco, it was easy for the FBI to surveil the pair. \u201cHer controller did not seem to realize that the FBI would be all over him if he was meeting with her in public,\u201d said Matthew Brazil, co-author of Chinese Communist Espionage: An Intelligence Primer. \u201cThat is definitely a training problem.\u201d Other spies working for China \u2014 Candance Marie Claiborne, Ron Rockwell Hansen, and Jerry Chun Shing Lee (\u674e\u632f\u6210 L\u01d0 Zh\u00e8nch\u00e9ng)\u2014 all showed signs of slapdash tradecraft. The MSS appears to be aware of this training problem. It does not send its ranking spies into the U.S. unless they have diplomatic immunity. So, while Fang\u2019s handler was protected, she, as a low-level recruit, was not. She was expendable, but also a liability to the MSS. Evidence of China\u2019s intelligence higher-ups\u2019 willingness to sacrifice operatives better trained than Fang is seen in the case of Chi Mak (\u9ea5\u5927\u5fd7 D\u00e0i D\u00e0zh\u00ec), one of the most productive Chinese intelligence officers ever caught in the U.S, a man who helped the P.R.C. steal the designs of NASA\u2019s Space Shuttle, a crime for which the recruit he ran, Dongfan Chung (\u949f\u4e1c\u8543 Zh\u014dng D\u014dngf\u00e1n), was convicted in 2010. Beijing did nothing to get Chi Mak out of his 24-year sentence in a federal prison. Rather than trade him for one of the CIA spies Beijing caught in the early 2010\u2019s, they executed the American agents leaving Chi Mak to die in the Federal Correctional Institute at Lompoc, CA, on Halloween 2022. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to care very much about their operatives,\u201d Brazil said. Beijing appears to have adopted a flood-the-zone strategy whose danger is hard to downplay. \u201cThe Chinese make up for their unsophistication with hard work,\u201d Eftimiades said. \u201cThey are just throwing numbers at the problem. The MSS has bad tradecraft. It doesn\u2019t matter. They are going after so many people, and an intelligence service can be crippled by just a single spy within it.\u201d Historically, non-democratic, centrally-planned governments have excelled at gathering information but fallen short when knowing what to do with it because analysts tasked with making sense of the collected data don\u2019t feel free to speak their minds. \u201cBad analysis is inherent to communist regimes. In communism, politicization is particularly severe. Intelligence officials could not say Marxism is failing,\u201d Maddrell said. \u201cWhat the Cold War shows is that the open societies did better, but only because they did better at analysis. Open societies won the Cold War because they were better at analysis\u2026hands down, the Communists won the human intelligence and technical intelligence war. The West won only because they understood the intelligence better.\u201d Influence Much of the recent concern over Chinese intelligence has revolved around influence operations, particularly the idea that TikTok ultimately answers to the CCP. Donald Trump\u2019s order banning the app vaguely cited influence as his reason, a line of thinking that has been largely preserved by the U.S. intelligence community under the administration of his successor, President Joseph Biden. \u201cBeijing is intensifying efforts to mold U.S. public discourse \u2014 particularly by trying to shape U.S. views of sensitive or core sovereignty issues, such as Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong \u2014 and pressure perceived political opponents,\u201d said the February 2023 Annual Threat Assessment from the office of the Director of National Intelligence. Paul Heer, a former U.S. intelligence official working on China as a fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, said that there are few signs that Beijing\u2019s influence operations in the U.S. are worth worrying over. \u201cI am not that concerned with their influence\u2026it is not that effective,\u201d Heer told The China Project. One does not need to be an expert to realize that China\u2019s influence operations show little sign of threatening the U.S. Over the last decade, since X\u00ed J\u00ecnp\u00edng\u2019s \u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73 rise to the role of China\u2019s paramount leader in 2012, American public opinion of China has grown significantly more negative. An April study by the Pew Research Center shows that the number of Americans with an \u201cunfavorable\u201d view of China rose from 36% in 2011 to 83% today. What positive influence Beijing did have in Washington has largely been squandered. American business used to temper Washington\u2019s mistrust of Beijing, said a source close to the U.S. business community in China. Despite frictions such as trade imbalances, intellectual property theft, and human rights violations throughout the 2000s and into the early 2010s, large American corporations \u201casked D.C. to give China some space.\u201d But Beijing\u2019s spies hacking into the computers of those very companies that asked Washington to cut China some slack, soured them on China. Now, the source said, American businesses are quietly cheering on officials bashing Beijing. \u201cChina went too far. China earned this, China is responsible for this.\u201d HR Nightmare China\u2019s spies who have made cyberhacking their primary modus operandi have been a much greater threat to American security than TikTok and spy balloons combined. In what is arguably the worst security breach in history, the Chinese hacked the U.S. government\u2019s human resources department, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). In November 2013, Chinese hackers began snooping around OPM systems. By March 2014, the OPM realized that Chinese hackers were inside , but the OPM thought the hack was contained. On May 27, 2014, the OPM conducted what it called the \u201cBig Bang,\u201d a major reset of their system to clean out attackers. But it was too late. Chinese hackers had already installed malware to create a backdoor into the OPM system. It was not until almost a year later, on April 15, 2015, that OPM security officials realized they were still being hacked. By that point, the attackers had stolen data on 22.1 million people, targeting those whose applications for U.S. government security clearance made them prime targets and potential assets for recruitment by Beijing. Each security clearance applicant\u2019s required SF-86 form detailed sensitive information, including health, financial, and criminal records, histories of gambling, sexual partners, and drug and alcohol use \u2014 all information that could be used as leverage in blackmail. Also included in what the hackers stole from the OPM were usernames and passwords that could compromise a targets\u2019 other protected log-ins elsewhere on the internet. The hackers even obtained 1.1 million sets of fingerprints. After the breach was exposed, U.S. officials concluded it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that every file associated with an OPM-managed security clearance application since the year 2000 had data lost to these hackers, data that could easily have helped Beijing target spies such as Kevin Mallory, who they reached out to through LinkedIn. The OPM hack was only one in a series of damaging hacks begun early in the 21st century, when China realized that, because of changes in technology, they had an opportunity to level the espionage playing field. \u201cThey realized correctly that breaking into someone\u2019s computer system can be a million times more productive \u2014 and I say that literally \u2014 than breaking into the embassy safe,\u201d Brazil said. The rise in China\u2019s cyberespionage began in 2003 with Titan Rain, an operation that over two years targeted computer networks in the U.S. Departments of State, Homeland Security, and Energy. Following Titan Rain, there were numerous other Chinese cyber attacks with names like Aurora, which, in 2009, targeted the U.S. high-tech industry, stealing data from Silicon Valley software giant Adobe Systems and Cambridge, MA cloud computing leader Akamai Technologies. Beginning in 2014, Chinese hackers tapped hotel chain Marriott for gigabytes of data, including 327 million passport numbers. Despite a 2015 agreement between Barack Obama and Xi Jinping to take steps to stem the tide of cyber espionage, after which hacking dropped off for nine months, Chinese hacking continued unabated. In 2017, credit reporting agency Equifax lost the sensitive financial data of about 145 million Americans, a crime for which the U.S. government, by this time embarrassed and fed up, publicly charged ranking members of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, citing a trove of evidence. China denied any involvement. Though China\u2019s cyber spies are excellent at breaking into American computer systems and stealing massive amounts of data, as with their humint gathering, they seem not to care about covering their tracks. \u201cChina\u2019s hacking is often sloppier and easier to spot,\u201d author Gordon Corera wrote in his book Cyberspies. \u201cRussia\u2019s hackers are more expert and operate below the radar.\u201d However, James Lewis, senior vice president of CSIS, a Washington think tank, cautions that the Chinese may have been sloppy but they are improving. \u201cThey were clumsy and noisy a decade ago. Today, they are almost as good as the U.S. They are still catching up, but they have gotten a lot better.\u201d Economic espionage with a military bent Prime among China\u2019s cyberhacking targets are U.S. military technology companies. The case of S\u016b B\u012bn \u82cf\u658c is typical of the economic espionage China conducts against the U.S. Su was a Chinese national living in British Columbia running a successful aerospace company called Lode Tech, living a comfortable Canadian lifestyle and helping his wife raise their two Canadian-born children. Two hackers in China who breached the computer systems of nearby aerospace giant Boeing, in Seattle, worked closely with Su to steal the plans for Boeing\u2019s C-17 Globemaster transport plane. Once the hackers entered Boeing\u2019s system, Su employed his engineering knowledge to guide them as to what they should steal. In an email bluntly subject-lined \u201cRe: C-17_2,\u201d Su wrote to the spies, \u201cThere are many picture documents. The useful ones are marked in yellow. Many documents are for application. They should be the computer documents of a person who uses airplane [sic], not the computer documents of a designer.\u201d After the hackers had stolen 65 gigabytes of Boeing\u2019s data, Su flew to China to help the spies and engineers interpret the stolen materials. In an email between the two hackers working with Su that appeared in court documents in his case, one hacker explained to the other what China liked to steal from the U.S. \u201cThe focus on the U.S. is primarily on the military technologies, but it also touches other areas\u2026.we still have control on American companies like [expunged] and etc. and the focus is mainly on those American enterprises which belong to the top 50 arms companies in the world.\u201d Joshua Skule, a former head of an FBI intelligence group who now heads his own technology security company, told Reuters in 2018 that approximately 70% of Chinese espionage against the U.S. is aimed at stealing secrets from companies, not the government. Eftimiades agrees. \u201cThe vast majority of espionage is not directed against the national security apparatus, but against commercial companies and technologies with military applications,\u201d Eftimiades said. American officials are right to complain that Chinese spies are stealing vast amounts of data from American companies, and often complain that this behavior is unique to China. Michael Hayden, a former director of the U.S. National Security Agency, told Cyberspies author Corera, that while American signals intelligence and Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters also intercept foreign company data, they do so with the sole goal of keeping British and American subjects safe and free: We don\u2019t steal things to make Americans or, in GCHQ\u2019s case, British subjects, rich. The Chinese do. And they do it on a massive scale. That\u2019s the difference between what free people do in terms of signals intelligence and what the Chinese are doing. The free peoples of France and Israel might disagree. The intelligence services of these two countries are, behind those of China and Russia, among the most prolific at stealing American economic secrets and handing them off to their own countries\u2019 companies, doing exactly what China does. It is notable that American intelligence does not retaliate in kind, spreading competitive intelligence gathered in the field to American companies, leaving them instead to compete for themselves in the marketplace. \u201cThe U.S. has been unusual in that regard,\u201d said Loch Johnson, an editorial board member of the Journal of Intelligence History. \u201dWhat makes China\u2019s economic espionage unique is not the fact that they are doing it but the scale at which they\u2019re pulling it off.\u201d Back to the Future With the rise in attention being paid to U.S.-China relations and Chinese spying, it is prudent to remember that trans-Pacific spy wars are as old as the PRC. John Delury, an American professor of Chinese history at Yonsei University in Seoul, recently published Agents of Subversion about the U.S.-China intelligence relationship in the 1950s. The event at the core of the book involves the capture of two CIA officers who violated Chinese airspace in order to spy. When the U.S. government learns the officers are alive in a prison in Beijing, the State Department lies to the world, claiming the officers died when their plane was downed on a civilian mission. The agents become pawns in a larger standoff and years pass before the American families are informed of the truth. Delury is concerned that Balloongate and the perceived TikTok bomb may presage a return to a U.S.-China relationship that is more like the 1950s, when the State Department prevented American citizens from going to China and China sank into thirty years of centrally-planned self-destruction. With hostility and paranoia increasing on both sides, interest in espionage has become \u201cthe new normal,\u201d said Delury, quick to remind that even during the brief, best years of U.S.-China relations, in the 1980s \u2014 before 1989 \u2014 and then again the 2000s, neither side quit spying on the other. Delury wonders if officials on both sides can manage the relationship in a responsible way to prevent it from backsliding into the past. \u201cThe question is how bad is it going to get and how low is it going to go.\u201d Backsliding? Chinese espionage in the U.S. is dangerous, but many experts believe the threat is being overhyped. Chinese intelligence \u201cis not ten feet tall,\u201d Brazil said. \u201cThey are not monster cockroaches gripping knives between their teeth, crawling up our arms. It is just spying.\u201d Good counterintelligence work should suffice, Brazil said, and the U.S. should treat Chinese spying like Russian spying: \u201cThe FBI gets very upset when I tell them this.\u201d Instead of not taking Chinese espionage seriously enough, the U.S. faces the possibility that it is taking the threat too seriously, especially in the run up to the U.S. general elections. \u201cSome individuals can advance their political careers by creating external enemies,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cNow, we have people who are using China as a way to show their toughness and their masculinity. It works for them. But it is very dangerous. It creates this mythology that we have.\u201d So why are TikTok and LinkedIn treated differently? Perhaps it\u2019s because Americans have a difficult time imagining that the leadership of the Sunnyvale, CA social network (which employs roughly 21,000 people and is owned by publicly-listed tech giant Microsoft) would be careless enough to expose its 900 million registered users to exploitation by Chinese spies seeking classified information. Conversely, it is easy for U.S. politicians to vilify and transform TikTok into a Chinese boogeyman in an election season when it is politically expedient to do so. Despite the unbalanced threat assessment, Delury remains hopeful about U.S.-China relations. \u201cThe Chinese people are awesome, and the American people are okay, too, if you get to know us,\u201d he said, noting, thankfully, that since the late 1970s personal connections across the Pacific have blossomed, linking China and the U.S. and acting as ballast against turbulence when it arose in, say, 1989, in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, when U.S. companies turned their backs on China, or again in 1999, when the U.S. bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and Chinese boycotted American businesses. \u201cThere are still deep reservoirs in the relationships Americans and Chinese people have built up,\u201d Delury said, adding a note of caution: \u201cBut those connections are on the backfoot.\u201d",

            "text": "A Minnesota state senator was caught in a compromising position during a virtual legislative session on Monday.Minnesota State Senator Calvin Bahr was voting via Zoom during a Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor Zoom meeting and, when it was his time to vote, he was seen on screen for a split-second voting \"yes\" while partially topless and covered with a blanket.A background still of School House Rock's famous I'm Just a Bill can be seen behind Bahr as he votes. The lawmaker, who was elected to his current position in 2022 following three terms as a state representative, seemed stunned to be on camera.After he appeared and voting continued, individuals in different panels can be seen smiling and attempting to hold back laughter. Bahr seemed to catch himself in the moment, quickly shutting off the camera to display only his name.Newsweek reached out to Bahr via email for comment.Zoom mishaps are not new and accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic when people in work settings often had no option to meet in person.Jeffrey Toobin, a lawyer and former longtime CNN legal analyst who spent about 20 years on the network, made national headlines in October 2020 when he was caught masturbating on a live video feed.It happened while he was participating in an election simulation with staff from The New Yorker and radio station WNYC ahead of the 2020 presidential election.One month later, Toobin was fired by The New Yorker after approximately 30 years at the magazine. He was also put on an eight-month hiatus from CNN, where he returned in June 2021 and called his actions \"deeply moronic and indefensible.\" He later left the network permanently in August 2022.Last August, former Alaska governor and House candidate Sarah Palin was participating in a Native Peoples Action candidate forum broadcast on Zoom when she was interrupted by the drawing of a penis that took over the screen.When event organizers attempted to apologize for the mishap, labeled as a \"Zoom bomb,\" an unidentified voice became audible and called Palin derogatory words.Arguably the most infamous webcam footage occurred in the years prior to the pandemic, now known ubiquitously as \"BBC Dad.\"Professor Robert Kelly was conducting an interview with the BBC in March 2017 when both of his children entered the closed room, attracting Kelly's attention while he still attempted to partake in a real-time interview.Kelly's wife can later be seen running into the room to collect the children and attempt to salvage her husband's interview.The pandemic aided Zoom's profits in a gigantic way. Zoom Video Communications' revenue in 2020 was $622.7 million, up 88 percent from the previous year.However, Zoom settled a privacy lawsuit in 2021 for $85 million related to security concerns\u2014or more specifically, allegations that the Silicon Valley company shared users' personal information with platforms like Facebook, Google and Microsoft-owned LinkedIn.While many workers have returned to their offices or places of work, numerous others continue to utilize Zoom from their work-from-home roles.A poll of 1,500 eligible voters in the U.S. conducted in March for Newsweek by Redfield & Wilton Strategies found that millennials, typically born between 1981 and 1996, find it \"rude\" to leave cameras off during work meetings.Older American workers, or those aged 55 to 64, were least likely to find any issue with cameras off during meetings.",

            "title": "WordPress becomes latest major company to drop Twitter over API prices",
            "text": "Popular website-creation platform WordPress has become the latest to drop Twitter over the social media\u2019s sudden, steep price hikes for its API, joining major companies like Microsoft and Intercom. WordPress bloggers and other content creators will no longer be able to use the plugin Jetpack Social to automatically share their posts with Twitter, according to a statement Monday. An API, short for application programming interface, acts as an intermediary that lets two applications communicate with each other and share data. It\u2019s what lets e-commerce sites use third-party payment systems like PayPal, for example, or how your phone\u2019s weather app gets its info from weather organizations. Before Elon Musk, Twitter maintained free options for its API, which allowed developers to integrate the social media platform into their own apps or projects. This free access officially ended on April 29 \u2014 companies must now pay $42,000 to $210,000 a month for Twitter\u2019s \u201centerprise\u201d subscription. In WordPress\u2019s statement titled \u201cThe End of Twitter Auto-Sharing,\u201d the company said \u201cTwitter decided, on short notice, to dramatically change the terms and pricing of the Twitter API. We have attempted to work with Twitter in good faith to negotiate new terms, but we have not been able to reach an agreement.\u201d WordPress users can still manually post their blogs on Twitter, but the platform\u2019s auto-sharing capabilities no longer work with the social media. Jetpack\u2019s auto-sharing still functions on sites like Tumblr, Facebook and LinkedIn, and will soon work with Instagram and Mastodon, the company continued. An official plugin run by WordPress, Jetpack lets users automatically share new content on various social media, alongside offering tools for security, analytics, performance and more. \u201cWe wish the outcome had been different, but our customers are always our primary concern, and we\u2019re not willing to compromise the experience or value you receive from Jetpack,\u201d WordPress\u2019 statement reads. With its announcement, WordPress joins the countless small developers and, more recently, major companies stepping away from Twitter over its API pricing. Shortly after Twitter announced the change, scores of developers said the new pricing will force them to shutter their Twitter-based apps \u2014 killing services like TwitExplorer, Twitter HP, FeedHive and much more. Then, days before the change set in, Microsoft announced it would drop Twitter from its Microsoft Advertising platforms instead of paying the new fees. Musk responded by threatening to sue Microsoft, claiming the company trained their AI \u201cillegally using Twitter data.\u201d Microsoft wasn\u2019t done. Days later, gaming platform Xbox, owned by the tech giant, announced over Twitter they\u2019d disabled the ability for users to directly share game clips with the social media using the console. Around the same time, Intercom, a popular customer service and live chat company, announced they had dropped the site\u2019s Twitter integration over its API pricing. A striking move, given Twitter has become a \u201ckey customer support channel,\u201d per its own marketing. Meanwhile, Twitter\u2019s API changes have already stopped numerous automated bots from posting. Unfortunately, these included important public service bots \u2014 like those that give emergency alerts, weather updates, public transit changes and more. When he first announced the API changes, Musk positioned the prices as a way to kill off Twitter\u2019s bots. So far, it appears to have killed off much more. SHARE",

            "title": "Godfather of AI' quits Google and warns of the dangers of artificial intelligence",
            "text": "A prominent researcher in artificial intelligence, known as the 'Godfather of AI' has quit his job at Google, and has issued a chilling warning on the risks the burgeoning technology poses to society. Dr Geoffrey Hinton is widely credited with laying the groundwork which would lead to the creation of increasingly popular 'chatbots' using artificial intelligence (AI), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and others. With their growing popularity, Dr Hinton is just one of a number of experts speaking out about the harm AI could cause. The 75-year-old said he left Google so he could \"talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google.\" His statement comes following an article in the New York Times, in which he said writer Cade Metz \"implies\" Dr Hinton left so he \"could criticise Google\". He went on to rebuff the idea, saying: \"Google has acted very responsibly.\" Dr Hinton said he left Google in order to speak more freely about the potential harms widespread and unrestrained AI developmentc could pose. He listed the spread of misinformation and upheaval in the jobs market and other, more nefarious uses. \"Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now,\" Hinton said in the interview published Monday, May 1. \"Take the difference and propagate it forwards. That's scary.\" He went on to say: \"It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things.\" Dr Hinton let Google know of his plans to step down last month, and spoke to the company's CEO Sundar Pichai personally on Thursday, April 27, according to the NY Times article. He didn't discuss the specifics of the phone call. In a statement, Google's chief scientist said: \"We remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We're continually learning how to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\" Among those who have also issued warnings about AI is Elon Musk, who, along with more than 1,000 other prominent AI figures, called for a six-month pause in advanced AI development in March, citing the potential \"profound risks to society and humanity\". In the interview with the NY Times, Dr Hinton expressed concerns at the pace at which AI is developing, and that it has begun to outpace the human mind in some areas. He also talks of concerns that the pace of AI development will increase after Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google and other tech giants race to become leaders in the field - with potentially dangerous consequences. One of the fears discussed by Dr Hinton was the potentially devastating impact the use of AI could have on the job market. AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are currently used alongside human workers, to complement and aide their work - however, they could go on to replace positions such as paralegals, personal assistants, translators and people carrying out repetitive tasks. \"It takes away the drudge work,\" he told the NY Times. \"It might take away more than that.\" Then there are the issues we could face in the future as the technology learns unexpected behaviour from the huge amounts of data they analyse. He explained that this becomes an issue as individuals and companies allow AI systems not only to generate their own computer code, but to run it unsupervised. Dr Hinton went on to say he fears a day when truly autonomous weapons become a reality. \"The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people - a few people believed that,\" he explained. \"But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. \"I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.\" Dr Hinton is a British expatriate and lifelong academic, studying at the University of Edinburgh before going on to become a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, leaving the university for Canada as he was reluctant to take Pentagon funding. At that time, the 1980s, most AI research in the US was funded by the Defense Department, but Dr Hinton said he is and always has been deeply against the use of AI on the battlefield, or \"robot soldiers\", as he calls it. Since 2013, Dr Hinton split his time between being a professor at the University of Toronto, and a Google engineering fellow. He joined Google after the company acquired a startup he co-founded with two of his students - Alex Krishevsky and Ilya Sutskever. The professor and his student developed a neural network, a mathematical system that learns skills by analysing data, which trained itself to identify common objects by analysing photos. Sutskever is currently the chief scientist for OpenAI. In 2018, Dr Hinton and two other collaborators received the Turing Award for their work on neural networks.",

            "title": "Redfall Xbox review \u2013 an open world vampire game that lacks bite",
            "text": "Redfall \u2013 better with friends, probably (pic: Microsoft) From the creators of Dishonored and Prey comes a new four-player shooter that is Bethesda\u2019s biggest budget Xbox Series X/S exclusive so far. Whether you loathe the term immersive sim or merely dislike it, the genre it describes, in which you solve problems using weapons, special powers, and the environment, is a rarefied one, with developer Arkane one of its last remaining proponents. Starting with Arx Fatalis in the early 2000s, then Dishonored and its sequel, they also made Prey and more recently Deathloop, all of which rely on elements of the genre. Perhaps less well known is that the studio was also developing a multiplayer game, called The Crossing, in the mid-2000s, which was cancelled before release. Since then Arkane\u2019s interest in online gaming hasn\u2019t abated. Deathloop had an interesting mechanic where a second player could invade your game as an assassin, forcing you to abandon your current objective and defend yourself. And now there\u2019s Redfall, which is designed to be played in up to four-player co-op. Like Deathloop it, too, is set on a strange island, cut off from the rest of the world, only this time it\u2019s not populated by immortals from the 1960s, but a nasty cadre of vampires and the cult members who support them. The perimeter of the island\u2019s surrounded by a massive tidal wave, frozen in time, its vast curled crest hanging threateningly in the sky, with ships and debris trapped inside it. On land there\u2019s a mixture of houses and commercial buildings, as well as a scattering of twisted magical structures. It\u2019s largely empty though, the island\u2019s citizens having either run away or been used as food by the blood suckers \u2013 there are a few hapless residents to rescue, but not many. Meanwhile armed cult members roam the island and will shoot you on sight. Unlike their followers, vampires don\u2019t carry guns, instead swooping in for clawed melee attacks. Fortunately, they\u2019re susceptible to bullets, which you use to weaken them before applying a good old stake to the heart. But bullets aren\u2019t the only thing you can use to defend yourself. More unusual weapons in Redfall include the stake launcher, which flings pretty much any sharp object you find, from pokers to broken pool cues, enabling you to spear your prey from a distance. You can also temporarily petrify vampires using a portable UV light. Once immobilised, a quick blast from a shotgun and they explode into satisfyingly small fragments. The rest of your arsenal, from assault rifles to handguns, is more prosaic, the gunplay turning out to be competent rather than exhilarating, and certainly nothing that will have Bungie looking nervously over its shoulder. Even more so than weapons, your choice of hero influences both play style and the options available during battles. Jacob is a former mercenary for fictional private military contractor, Bellwether. Their troops are on the island as well, albeit in smaller numbers than the cultists, but they have no regard for being his former colleagues and will shoot him just as readily as anyone else. To fight back, Jacob has an invisibility cloak, a spectral sniper rifle, and a raven who marks nearby enemies, so that both you and teammates can see them through walls. Layla\u2019s an expert in telekinesis and can fling other players into the air, throw up a bullet shield, and call in her vampire ex-boyfriend as a short-term ally. Devinder\u2019s a famous author and YouTube cryptid hunter who can teleport, throw an electrified javelin, and has a UV light big enough to petrify whole groups of vampires. Finally, Remi works in international rescue and can heal everyone, throw C4, and distract groups of enemies with his siren command. More interestingly, those powers combine with each other. Jacob\u2019s cloak makes nearby players invisible, and everyone can be levitated by Layla. You can also use Remi\u2019s explosives on vampires petrified by Devinder\u2019s UV lamp, giving a range of possibilities for a well-balanced team of heroes. Frustratingly, Redfall has no public matchmaking, only letting you play with people on your friends list who also own a copy of the game, which during the review process was, of course, nobody at all. It\u2019s a peculiar choice, that seemed out of step in Nintendo\u2019s Advance Wars 1+2 but doubly so in an 18-rated Xbox game. If you don\u2019t happen to know three real-life friends that own the game then you\u2019re not going to be able to play it the way Arkane obviously intended, which will force everyone to join Looking for Group communities elsewhere instead of everything just being handled sensibly in-game. To be fair, the game works perfectly well solo, automatically rebalancing its difficulty for solo players, but there are so many places where you can tell it wants you to go in all guns blazing, popping off special powers like confetti. On your own there\u2019s still plenty of action, but not the kind of chaotic fun that often emerges when you have three friends along for the ride. You can detect plenty of hints of its immersive sim background, too. Bigger objectives can be approached in multiple ways, from climbing up to the roof to picking locks or breaking windows, sacrificing stealth for expediency, but these moments are in the minority. Most of the time you\u2019ll be walking the island\u2019s wide streets, taking out groups of cultists or vampires, or both, on the way to your next mission objective. Vampires come in a range of flavours that includes Sin-Eaters, that trigger a psychic echo \u2013 a spooky cut scene from the past \u2013 when you kill them; Siphons who drain your blood from a distance; and the Rook. He\u2019s massive and arrives when you\u2019ve either killed a lot of vampires or completed a number of objectives, acting as a mini-boss to be fought wherever you happen to be when his power bar fills up. That can also trigger some neat emergent gameplay. When the Rook arrives and there are Bellwether troops in the area, they\u2019ll merrily fight each other while you pick off stragglers from the sidelines. The mercenaries also attack cultists, so you\u2019ll sometimes stumble across firefights naturally occurring in the game\u2019s ecosystem. Vampire nests spring up at random, supercharging nearby enemies and gradually growing in power and scale until you head in and destroy them. Entering a nest is reminiscent of the surreal, fractured landscapes of the Void in Dishonored, where Corvo went to meet the Outsider. Here all you\u2019ll be meeting is numerous angry vampires, keen to defend their home turf. You need to dispatch them and destroy the nest\u2019s heart, then try and escape before the whole edifice collapses. The plot\u2019s sketched in with the usual plethora of readables, along with psychic echoes and blood-soaked environmental storytelling. You can tell Redfall cares far more about its action than the narrative underlying it, but there\u2019s a backstory to uncover that does at least provide some overarching motivation for all the death dealing. Redfall \u2013 it\u2019s not really a horror game (pic: Microsoft) You\u2019ll also find a few bugs, all of which seemed to resolve themselves within a few minutes, and none of which required a restart of the game. There are other problems though, most notably when you have to find an object in the environment but can\u2019t. When there are four people swarming an objective those stray quest items might well be discovered in moments, but on your own they can sometimes prove annoyingly elusive. With its emphasis on action, there aren\u2019t many opportunities for a more thoughtful approach, something past immersive sims have been particularly good at. There are lots of neat little touches however, from the multitude of Dishonored references to a save system that operates entirely in the background. Unfortunately, the whole thing can feel like less than the sum of its parts. With the more strategic interest of immersive sims mostly absent you\u2019re left with exploration and firefights, which Redfall does fine, even if neither would be anyone\u2019s idea of best-in-class. The voice acting and art style are both excellent though, and even though it lacks Dunwall\u2019s awesome splendour, there\u2019s still a melancholic, lived-in beauty to the place. It may well be that playing with friends will bring Redfall to greater life but without that option, what\u2019s left is a decent action game that doesn\u2019t do enough to leverage the unique properties of its developer\u2019s favourite genre. When people were mistaking it for a Left 4 Dead clone, Bethesda were instead quick to compare Redfall to Far Cry but neither franchise seems like the sort of thing a developer of Arkane\u2019s reputation should be looking to for inspiration, in what is a disappointingly unremarkable romp. Redfall review summary In Short: Immersive sim meets four-player co-op in this vampire themed first person shooter that features competent gunplay but a lack of ingenuity in its challenges. Pros: Large, well architected open world environments. Some unusual weapons and heroes with abilities that make them each quite different to play. Cons: Lacks the usual tactical interest of immersive sims. Baffling lack of public matchmaking, despite its orientation towards co-op. Shooting action that\u2019s good but not great. Some minor bugs.

            "title": "Education has a key role to play in unlocking the potential of AI",
            "text": "For many people, artificial intelligence (AI) has been something typically confined to science-fiction films \u2013 but more and more it is creeping into our homes, universities and workplaces. So how will AI will disrupt the working world and what advice do academics have in terms of course selection at this early stage in the technology? Dr Oisin Cawley, a lecturer and researcher in computing at South East Technological University (SETU), makes the point that AI has actually been around in one guise or another for some time already. \u201cIf we consider the car industry, for example, automated assembly lines have been manufacturing the cars for years,\u201d he says. \u201cIs that not AI? \u201cMuch of modern AI is far more low-key and is rapidly sneaking into many aspects of our lives. This low-key AI has been around for a while and I think that is where much of the disruption will be felt.\u201d Artificial intelligence is \u201cexcellent\u201d at automating routine and mundane tasks such as data entry, customer support in the form of chatbots and other administrative tasks, says Cawley. \u201cAI is in heaven when it is asked to analyse data \u2013 lots of data,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt can churn data inside out and upside down to find interesting patterns and make future predictions. It can do this in a fraction of the time a human can and in fact can find patterns that humans would not. \u201cHave a guess how many students are trying to use AI to make stock-market predictions.\u201d We are all familiar with the notorious internet cookie business. The cookies gather information about us and companies analyse it to personalise products and services specifically for us. All these tasks were previously performed by people. So, what happens to these people? Certainly, fewer people are needed in these roles, which is good for business. Or is it? \u201cConventional wisdom would suggest that as AI starts to take over these more repetitive tasks, people are freed up to concentrate on those tasks which require higher-level thinking and creativity,\u201d says Cawley. \u201cI would suggest that most jobs have repetitive, mundane tasks that will be affected by AI in this way. Take software developers, for example. They write the code that runs our apps. In many cases code can be reused. But AI is very good at learning coding patterns and already there are AI assistants that can write code for you. The software developer role has the potential to change to one where coding, creativity, user experience, and AI are all harnessed together.\u201d I don\u2019t think undergraduates should worry too much about AI-specific courses unless they specifically want to focus on AI as a subject. I think AI will have a role in almost all subjects\u2014 Dr Oisin Cawley Cawley points out that even in more artistic roles such as graphic design, AI has made huge strides. \u201cCheck out OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E application which can create images from a text description given by the user,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can easily see the potential for this to be extended into areas such as design and architecture.\u201d So how does all this change the landscape for students and teachers? \u201cIt is a very interesting time when it comes to education,\u201d says Cawley. \u201cAs educators, we need to be cognisant of the potential of AI, both in terms of how it may disrupt the working world but also what skills people should have to exploit this potential.\u201d This is relevant not just to someone looking to start third-level education, but also for people already in employment. \u201cIn the area of computing at SETU, we have been focusing on building the AI skills of our undergraduate students on both software development and computer-games degree courses,\u201d says Cawley. \u201cOur aim is to give them enough knowledge to know how to use AI to solve problems which will hopefully translate to the workplace. Employers are aware of the growing importance of AI and so they like to see graduates with some level of knowledge and skill in this area. \u201cTo serve more mature students we run a Master of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence and a Master of Science in Data Science which caters for people who are looking to upskill into these specific areas. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t think undergraduates should worry too much about AI-specific courses unless they specifically want to focus on AI as a subject. I think AI will have a role in almost all subjects.\u201d Jack Kennedy, an economist at jobs website Indeed, says advances in AI can help not only with improving business performance but in wider areas such as vaccine development. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it will bring transformative developments to the way we work in the future,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are benefits of working in tandem with AI. We\u2019ve already seen how other technical advancements have impacted the way we work. \u201cFor instance, think of how software like Excel changed the way accountants work but didn\u2019t replace the need for accountants themselves. Often AI can help automate the admin or tasks that are time consuming, allowing people to concentrate on other areas of their job.\u201d For anyone concerned about the potential impact of AI on their career path, Kennedy has several pointers. \u201cRemaining flexible is key; with technological and social changes advancing rapidly, it\u2019s important to remain open about career changes or opportunities,\u201d he says. \u201cChange is inevitable, so rather than fighting it, figure out how you can use it as an opportunity for career advancement. This might mean upskilling or altering your career path. \u201cPeople skills or emotional intelligence is an area that AI will not be able to replicate in the same way a person can. Developing skills like communication, negotiation and navigating conflict can help future-proof your career against technological changes.\u201d TU Dublin lecturer Dr Rajesh Jaiswal teaches a Masters in Computing in Human-Centred AI; he says students should always have one eye on the future when selecting their courses. \u201cAI technology and related technologies are part of the latest wave of the information revolution and could be worth up to \u20ac125 billion by 2025,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the last two decades AI has rapidly advanced and transformed many industries, including education, healthcare, finance, transportation and entertainment. It will only continue to grow as these technologies become more advanced and widespread.\u201d Jaiswal says there is a skills gap in Ireland and internationally for data scientists with computing and business-intelligence skills. TU Dublin has a four-year degree course, BSc (Hons) in Computing with Machine Learning/AI, designed in consultation with big IT companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, SAP and IBM, which develops a mix of computing, business intelligence and data-science skills. \u201cThe rise of big data and cloud computing has made it easier to process large data sets and train complex AI models,\u201d says Jaiswal. \u201cAI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants have become more sophisticated, enabling businesses to automate customer service and improve user experiences. AI is also being used in healthcare to assist with diagnoses and drug discovery, and in finance to detect fraud and manage risks.\u201d As the application of AI is so wide, Jaiswal recommends that \u201call potential students\u201d should consider gaining skills that are increasingly important to many industries. \u201cAn AI product manager, for example, is less of a scientist and more of a marketing role \u2013 but they have to understand working with cross-functional teams to bring an AI product to market,\u201d he says. PwC director of people and organisation consulting Laoise Mullane says there are many courses that will help people get started in the AI space. \u201cSome colleges have specific AI courses but other areas such as data science, computer science, mathematics and statistics all provide a good grounding for a career in AI,\u201d she says. \u201cAs AI becomes more mainstream, we expect to see AI modules becoming a common feature of a variety of college courses such as business, law and HR.\u201d Dr Valerie Mc Taggart, the head of the department of social sciences ATU Sligo, has conducted research that focuses on the impact of digital technology to organisations and society. AIs will often present incorrect information as truth with 100 per cent certainty ... Humans will still have to be in the mix to ensure the information quality is high\u2014 Robert O'Connor \u201cLike previous digital developments, these disrupters have the potential to alter a marketplace at an alarming pace,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have seen several high-profile examples of the impact of the digital revolution on industries that did not capitalise on these digital developments. \u201cAs for the need for academic lecturing staff, suggestions have abounded that their role will become significantly reduced. Indeed, how can one person compete with all the information available to Chat GPT?\u201d Robert O\u2019Connor, a lecturer in computing at SETU, says advances in AI make him feel \u201csimultaneously giddy and horrified\u201d. \u201cI suspect one area where AI is likely to have an immediate impact is in automating repetitive office tasks,\u201d he says. Manual data entry, document formatting, move A into B and so on are examples of the kind of work AI tools can handle with ease. \u201cHowever, AIs aren\u2019t perfect,\u201d says O\u2019Connor. \u201cThey will often present incorrect information as truth with 100 per cent certainty and they also generate a significant number of \u2018hallucinations\u2019, which is where an AI will just make stuff up. \u201cHumans will still have to be in the mix to ensure the information quality is high. It\u2019s likely that some jobs may go \u2013 but others may take their place. We\u2019re already seeing job listings for \u2018prompt engineer\u2019, which is someone who can create high-value input for an AI tool.\u201d In terms of advice for students in terms of course selection at this early stage in the technology, O\u2019Connor says they should not be looking at courses with respect to what will be affected by AI. \u201cIf a person chooses a broad area in which they\u2019re genuinely interested \u2013 be it computer science, nursing, English, whatever \u2013 then it doesn\u2019t really matter about AI,\u201d he says. \u201cThese tools are going to affect pretty much everyone. If you\u2019re in an area that you like and have a passion for, you\u2019ll adapt. \u201cThe main skill third-level students need to develop is how to critically assess the quality of information presented and then make decisions based on that. \u201cStudents can do this by getting a foundation in their chosen discipline, understanding its general concepts and staying on top of current trends. Then, if an AI enters the mix, they can make an informed determination of the quality of the information it produces.\u201d",

            "title": "Jeffrey Epstein scheduled meetings with Noam Chomsky, CIA director and others: report",
            "text": "A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director, a top lawyer at Goldman Sachs and several high-profile academic scholars were reportedly named in Jeffrey Epstein\u2018s private calendar, new reports claim. According to documents obtained by the Wall Street Journal, several previously unnamed figures may have met with Epstein after 2008, when he pleaded guilty to soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. The WSJ report, published on Sunday, named a number of people in Epstein\u2019s calendar who had not been identified in his \u201cblack book,\u201d which is now public. Among the names allegedly listed in Epstein\u2019s calendar was the current CIA director William Burns, scholar Noam Chomsky, Bard College president Leon Botstein and top Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler. Epstein\u2019s \u201cblack book\u201d previously named the likes of Prince Andrew and Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz. The WSJ could not verify that all meetings reportedly in Epstein\u2019s calendar had ever taken place. The purpose of most of the meetings was not listed, and being named in the calendar is not an indicator of any sort of crime or connection to crime. In 2014, CIA director Burns was allegedly scheduled to meet with Epstein on three occasions. The then-deputy secretary of state was listed to first meet Epstein at his Manhattan townhouse. CIA spokesperson Tammy Kupperman Thorp denied Burns, 67, had any knowledge of Epstein\u2019s personal life at the time they met. \u201cThe director did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector and offered general advice on transition to the private sector,\u201d she told the WSJ. \u201cThey had no relationship.\u201d After one meeting at the townhouse, Epstein apparently planned for his driver to take Burns to the airport. Though Burns recalled meeting Epstein briefly via a mutual friend in Washington, he denied the other meetings in the calendar. \u201cThe director does not recall any further contact, including receiving a ride to the airport,\u201d Thorp told the outlet. Burns was nominated by President Biden to serve as CIA director in 2021. Chomsky, an American linguist and political activist, met with Epstein on a number of occasions throughout 2015 and 2016. He told the WSJ he and Epstein met to discuss politics and academia. One such meeting was allegedly with Chomsky, Epstein and former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak. As part of another meeting, Epstein scheduled a flight for Chomsky, 94, to have dinner with director Woody Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn. Chomsky\u2019s answer to a WSJ inquiry about whether or not he met with Epstein was simple. He wrote: \u201cFirst response is that it is none of your business. Or anyone\u2019s. Second is that I knew him and we met occasionally.\u201d In response to meeting specifically with Epstein and Allen, Chomsky told the WSJ, \u201cI\u2019m unaware of the principle that requires that I inform you about an evening spent with a great artist.\u201d Chomsky added that \u201cwhat was known about Jeffrey Epstein was that he had been convicted of a crime and had served his sentence. According to U.S. laws and norms, that yields a clean slate.\u201d Between 2002 and 2017, Epstein reportedly donated at least US$850,000 to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where Chomsky was a professor. MIT later claimed to have since donated the funds to charities that support victims of sexual abuse. Bard College president Botstein told the WSJ after being named that he met with Epstein in an attempt to secure funding for the school. He invited Epstein \u2014 who travelled with a group of \u201cyoung female guests\u201d \u2014 to the campus. On another occasion, Botstein met with Epstein to thank him for donating laptops to Bard. The WSJ reported Epstein and Botstein met more than two dozen times in four years, mostly at Epstein\u2019s Manhattan townhouse. \u201cWe looked him up, and he was a convicted felon for a sex crime,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe in rehabilitation.\u201d Ruemmler, a top Goldman Sachs lawyer, was at one point a White House counsel to President Obama. Between joining Goldman Sachs and working at the White House, the WSJ claimed Ruemmler met with Epstein \u201cdozens\u201d of times. In his calendar, Epstein reportedly wrote that he was to meet Ruemmler in Paris in 2015 and on his private island in the Caribbean in 2017. Ruemmler said she and Epstein had a professional relationship and denied ever travelling with him. A Goldman Sachs representative said Epstein introduced Ruemmler to several potential clients, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. \u201cI regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d Ruemmler told the WSJ. A number of other influential people were also named by the WSJ as being listed in Epstein\u2019s calendar. These included Ariane de Rothschild, CEO of the Swiss private bank Edmond de Rothschild Group; Harvard University professor Martin Nowak; Joshua Cooper Ramo, the vice chairman and co-chief executive of Henry Kissinger\u2019s consulting firm Kissinger Associates; and anthropologist Helen Fisher. Epstein was found dead in a New York jail cell of an apparent suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges. In February, lawyers for the former associate and girlfriend of Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, argued that her 20-year sentence for sex trafficking should be thrown out, or a new trial ordered. The legal filing claimed prosecutors should never have been able to press their case against Maxwell because of a deal Epstein reached in September 2007 with federal prosecutors in Florida that protected not only himself from prosecution but \u201cany potential coconspirators.\u201d \u2014 Read the complete Wall Street Journal report here.",

            "title": "Redefining the workforce: what jobs are AI likely to replace first?",
            "text": "The World Economic Forum has indicated that 85 million jobs may be displaced by the evolution in the division of work between humans and machines by 2025. However, it has also estimated that 97 million new roles may emerge in areas such as AI ethics, human AI interface, and reviewing of AI output. Forbes, the influential US finance magazine, has cited factory workers, couriers, investment analysts, customer service operatives and security guards as being most at risk from AI. PwC director of people and organisation consulting Laoise Mullane says the recent accelerated adoption of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, has the potential to have a far broader impact on the workforce than other forms of AI and automation. \u201cIt has the potential to significantly disrupt and displace a large share of tasks performed by workers,\u201d she says. \u201cJobs that focus on content creation, such as code, text, audio, video, images, may start to be impacted first \u2013 programming, coding, copywriting, customer service to name a few. \u201cRoles will shift to have a bigger focus to reviewing, refining and assuring the quality of the outputs of generative AI systems. \u201cWhile AI allows you to build better models to analyse data and automate decisions it still lacks the business understanding to turn these results into meaningful insights and actions.\u201d An AI tool such as Microsoft\u2019s Co-pilot, can help a programmer get started, but if someone can\u2019t make sense of the code it produces, then how will they determine the quality of the work?\u2014 Robert O\u2019Connor, a lecturer in computing at South East Technological University Robert O\u2019Connor, a lecturer in computing at South East Technological University (SETU), says identifying what jobs are in danger is \u201ca huge question and probably can\u2019t be answered quickly\u201d. \u201cIn my own field, computer science, we can see how AI tools can be used to write code,\u201d he says. \u201cDoes this mean the death of programmers? I don\u2019t think so. \u201cAn AI tool such as Microsoft\u2019s Co-pilot, can help a programmer get started, but if someone can\u2019t make sense of the code it produces, then how will they determine the quality of the work? \u201cIdeally, an AI might take you 70 per cent of the way there, but the remaining 30 per cent is coded by a human \u2013 and that will usually be the trickiest 30 per cent. \u201cHopefully, it will help us write better software overall because it frees up our time to work on more complex problems rather than focusing on the mundane tasks.\u201d",

            "title": "Games Inbox: Why is PS5 releasing so few new games?",
            "text": "What is taking PlayStation so long? (pic: Sony) The Tuesday letters page wonders why there are so few Zelda clones on Xbox and PlayStation, as one reader hopes Xbox doesn\u2019t get into VR. To join in with the discussions yourself email gamecentral@metro.co.uk Covid recoveryPlayStation not releasing enough games is one thing, but I wouldn\u2019t feel so bad about it if they\u2019d just explain why. You never see any interviews nowadays, so we never know what they\u2019re thinking or planning. Do they have a ton that got delayed because of the pandemic or did new ones just not get started because of it? Why are other companies recovering from Covid now, but Sony is not? How do you announce 12 live service games in three years and get through the first half of the first year without revealing what even one of them is? Or assuring existing fans that this is just going to be a sideline and that they\u2019ll still continue to release proper single-player games as well. I mean they will, right? Right?! It\u2019s the wall of the silence that is so frustrating and even if they do have a big summer show planned are they going to clam up again once it\u2019s over? I just don\u2019t understand anything of what Sony is doing right now. From a literal business point of view, it seems to make no sense.BBovril Bizarro WorldVery interesting article on Sony software sales being a lot worse than hardware and them actually getting in trouble with analysts, and presumably investors, for not releasing enough games. If I had money on Sony and I saw their current release schedule I\u2019d be worried my money was going to waste too. Especially with all this live service nonsense. Sony knows nobody wants it but they\u2019re ploughing ahead anyway, because they think it\u2019s a money-spinner. But it seems such a terrible risk. As GC points out, most live service games crash and burn in short order, it\u2019s literally throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. This is the opposite of the sort of prestige gaming that Sony has become known for up until this point. That means that the plan at the moment, as their hardware sales go through the roof, is to do the absolute opposite of what has going them to this point. Sony\u2019s only problem at the moment is that it isn\u2019t announcing or releasing new games. We know they\u2019re on the way so just hurry that up and stop being silly.Mickey Milestone releaseSo I saw a leaked review, where the guy got the embargo time wrong, and he said Redfall was the worst game of the year. If that\u2019s true, or even close to it, then Microsoft\u2019s nightmare is never going to end. Bad sales, no Activision Blizzard, and now their most expensive developer so far is churning out duds. If Starfield turns out bad I really don\u2019t know whether gaming fandom will be able to handle it. You\u2019ll have PlayStation fans going crazy with the trolling and Xbox fans getting hyper defensive, and we\u2019ll never get any peace and quiet again. I genuinely do feel that Xbox is at a turning point. If anything else goes really wrong, like Starfield, then I really can see Microsoft pulling the plug. Not immediately or drastically or anything but slowly losing interest, like Google, and just farming out their streaming tech or something. At this point Microsoft needs to prove that the world needs Xbox and they\u2019re not doing that right now.Dolan GC: It\u2019s not the worst game of the year, but it\u2019s also not great. Here\u2019s our review. E-mail your comments to: gamecentral@metro.co.uk Who to blameI\u2019m really enjoying Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, more so than I anticipated. I\u2019m playing it on quality mode since there\u2019s currently no VRR support. I\u2019m fine with the 30fps, though I hope Respawn add a balanced mode at 40fps \u2013 similar to Hogwarts Legacy. I feel that\u2019s a good compromise. The presentation and combat is a big step up from the previous game. It\u2019s a shame the PC port is riddled with problems. Lazy devs is the usual accusation but I can\u2019t imagine any game creator intends to put out a sub-standard product. Gamers moan about Xbox Series S being supported, so I imagine having to support numerous configurations on PC is no easy task. Not that I\u2019m excusing the game being broken for some PC players. It\u2019s a concerning trend, so I hope the issues are addressed as a priority. Maybe some kind of beta testing could be pushed out to players before launch? I would much rather a game was delayed than get a game at launch with a host of fixes in the works. Thanks to GC for highlighting some game-ending bugs. I will do my best not to get killed in the area GC specified.Anon GC: It\u2019s never lazy developers; it\u2019s almost always short-sighted and impatient publishers. Unbeatable valueI do think people underestimate how good value Nintendo games are. Sure the graphics might be up their with the Xbox and PlayStation but I\u2019m going to guess that Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom is at least as big as the last one and with 20% off on pre-orders, for a game that\u2019s only \u00a359.99 in the first place is a great deal. If it\u2019s like Breath Of The Wild I\u2019ll probably be playing this for most of the rest of the year and I can\u2019t think of anything else I could spend \u00a360 on and get that kind of value of money for. Video games are just great, aren\u2019t they?Cobalt41 Zelda substituteSince I don\u2019t have a Nintendo Switch I am starting to get a bit jelly about the idea of playing Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom but the nearest thing I can think of as a substitute is Elden Ring. I\u2019ve already beaten it twice though and don\u2019t really fancy a third try with the DLC. It\u2019s a shame they won\u2019t announce a date for that as I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s coming out this year at this rate. Even then it\u2019s not that similar to Zelda and it\u2019s surprising how few alternatives there really are. Genshin Impact and Immortals Fenyx Rising are kind of the closest but I can\u2019t say I particularly like either. And then things like Ghost Of Tsushima and Horizon Forbidden West are just straight action role-players, without really being that similar to Zelda. I don\u2019t know why Sony has never tried to create an alternative but I\u2019m especially surprised Microsoft never did. If they were sensible that\u2019s what they\u2019d turn the Fable remake into. Although who knows if the people who made Forza Horizon would really be up to that.Lasdon Fear NintendoSo even Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom has leaked out early now? What is going on? Nintendo is going to hate this, more than any other company, and I imagine they\u2019re going to crazy finding out who\u2019s fault it is. In this instance I support them. I\u2019m sick of dodging spoilers for two weeks before every new game release. If I was selling physical copies the last thing I\u2019d want to be doing is let copies leak out early because the retribution from publishers is going to be severe. Or at least that\u2019s what I would\u2019ve thought. I\u2019m kind of surprised it hasn\u2019t happened yet.Moony The favouriteSo at the moment is Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom the obvious favourite to be the best game of the year? I really don\u2019t see Final Fantasy 16 beating, even if it\u2019s good, which means the only other two big hitters that we know of are Starfield and Spider-Man 2. Unless it\u2019s radically different than the first one I really don\u2019t see Spider-Man 2 being a contender but Starfield\u2026 theoretically it could be. I know Bethesda have become a bit of a laughing stock for their bugs and jank, and bad dialogue, but they do make great open worlds and Starfield seems like a pretty interesting new IP and not really like anything else out there at the moment, even if some bit, like the lockpicking are straight out of Fallout and Skyrim. But really, it\u2019s going to be Zelda, isn\u2019t it? Given the universally good previews I really can\u2019t see it being anything else. I expect there\u2019ll be a lot of grousing about performance issues but I really don\u2019t see that making a difference in the court of public opinion. If Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet can be massive successes despite all the bugs then Zelda certainly can with just a slightly iffy frame rate.Courson Inbox also-ransMaybe Xbox was interested in making a VR headset when these patents were made but I can\u2019t believe the PlayStation VR2 hasn\u2019t put them off for good now. It\u2019s just a complete waste of everyone\u2019s time and money.Scooter I did not know Sega was American. The more you learn.Pablo GC: Also, Taito was founded by a Jewish Ukrainian fleeing war in Russia. This week\u2019s Hot TopicThe subject for this weekend\u2019s Inbox was suggested by reader Cabal, who asks how often do you buy a video game as soon as it comes out? Do you always buy games you\u2019re interested in day one or do you always wait until they\u2019re cheaper or the bugs have been worked out? If you take it on a case-by-case basis what is it that influences your decision the most and do things like pre-orders bonuses make a difference? Price is one obvious reason not to buy a game straight away, but what else puts you off and how have you made your recent decisions, including for upcoming games like Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom?

            "title": "Apple\u2019s Stock In Focus: More Profitable Than Banks - WorldNewsEra",
            "text": "Investors looking for the \u201cnext big thing\u201d will point toward companies like Stripe, Sofi or Square as the leading fintech stocks. Meanwhile, the next big thing to disrupt the financial sector may be sitting in plain sight. Apple grew its cash trove through legendary design and hardware, yet how Apple chooses to leverage its enormous reserve of cash may be what writes the next chapter for the world\u2019s most valuable company. The markets have clearly shifted from favoring top line growth to emphasizing bottom line strength. This reminder is echoed across every industry, but none more so than the finance industry where regional banks are defaulting due to high bond rates and depositor withdrawals. It\u2019s easy to dismiss the financial sector in today\u2019s tech focused market. After all, financials only account for 11% of the total market cap of the S&P 500, with 3 sectors ahead of it. However, all companies depend on loans, and when banks get scared, the credit window shuts, which tends to lead to outsized bankruptcies. Simply put, banks cause the worst kinds of recessions. We detailed this more here. Today, the tech industry has disrupted nearly every industry in its path from energy, to commerce, to automotive, to entertainment. Perhaps now is the time that tech will finally disrupt the banking sector. Apple Is More Profitable Than Banks JP Morgan has over $1.4 trillion on its balance sheet compared to Apple\u2019s $165 billion. However, Apple is more profitable with $99 billion in profit last year, which is higher than JP Morgan and Citi combined. What Apple has to boot is access to 1.2 billion iPhone users. Therefore Apple may not have as much cash as a bank, but it\u2019s fundamentally a more investable business model. For stock investors, Apple\u2019s large cash reserves are certainly not news as the company has more cash than any other tech stock. What\u2019s news is that the FED is aggressively draining liquidity from the system as a means to fight inflation, as shown in the chart below, that compares the trends in liquidity to the S&P 500. There has been a long-standing relationship to liquidity and asset prices, and until we can see a new liquidity cycle start, companies with cash will have better leverage over those that don\u2019t. You can also expect volatility in the markets to remain high until there\u2019s a new liquidity cycle, which we covered when we discussed where we hold cash. The longer this plays out, the more ways Apple can leverage its $165 billion in cash as consumers will seek better financing terms, higher yields and credit lines will also increase. For example, Apple recently launched a new high-yield savings account that offers a 4.15% interest rate, which is 10 times higher than the United States national average and 415 times higher than what Chase or Bank of America offers at 0.01%. Apple is also lending from its balance sheet for the first time ever through Apple Pay\u2019s Buy Now and Pay Later product. To illustrate how effective Apple\u2019s move into finance tech has become, the cornerstone product, Apple Pay, currently has 75 percent adoption among iPhone users. This is up from 10% in 2016. In addition to taking on banks, Apple is also competing with Mastercard and Visa with features that allow merchants to use iPhones and iPads to send and receive payments. The long-term goal is to replace wallets with iPhones. Apple has the best operating margin among the FAANG stocks at 30.7%. Net profit last quarter was $30 billion with free cash flow of also $30 billion. Apple is not immune to the effects felt across corporate bonds and mortgage securities. According to CNBC, the company has $13 billion in unrealized losses. These losses are not reported as long as Apple plans to hold to maturity, and as long as the bond issuers are solvent enough to repay the debt. Also, a loss of $13 billion is not detrimental to Apple, as the company generates $100 billion in free cash flow per year. Notably, the company used to have $250 billion in cash reserves before increasing buybacks in 2017. Apple has debt of $111 billion for a net cash balance of $54 billion. The company paid $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and repurchased shares worth $19.5 billion. What to Watch for in Q1 Earnings Apple is not a growth stock. The company is known for strong margins, outsized cash flows, and stable balance sheet. The company\u2019s revenue has been partly negatively impacted from the adverse FX movements. Analysts expect revenue to decline by (4.6%) YoY to $92.81 billion yet the company\u2019s revenue is expected to grow after the June quarter. On a fiscal year basis, Apple is expected to report a rebound next fiscal year: Apple has the highest operating margins among the FAANG stocks. For EPS, Apple is expected to report the following: Apple\u2019s main segments are iPhones, Macs, iPads, Wearables and Services. Of these, the Mac segment is dragging on Apple\u2019s results. Last quarter, Mac sales declined by (29%) YoY to $7.7 billion. Management expects revenue to decline double digits due to challenging comparable with the M1 Mac Books from last year and a weaker consumer. According to IDC, there was a YoY decline of (29%) in the shipments of traditional PCs in Q1 2023 due to weaker demand and excess inventory. The report from IDC suggests that Macs declined by (40%) in Q1 2023. iPhone sales in the December quarter declined by (8%) YoY to $65.8 billion yet were flat excluding foreign exchange rates. Management expects revenue to accelerate in the March quarter when compared to the Dec quarter, per the earnings call: \u201cFor iPhone, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to accelerate relative to the December quarter year-over-year revenue performance.\u201d According to the research firm Canalys, the global smartphone market declined by (13%) YoY in Q1 2023. The report from Canalys states that Apple gained 3% in global market share from 18% to 21% driven by the demand for iPhone 14 Pro series. Samsung was the only leading vendor to report QoQ growth and also regained the #1 position at 22% market share. The Services segment is the second largest segment after iPhone. This is where payment services and loan products will show up. Many investors see this as the long-term opportunity as Apple is monetizing it\u2019s installed base of over 2 billion active devices. The installed base grew by 8% YoY. Services revenue grew 6% YoY to $20.8 billion and grew double digits excluding foreign exchange rates. The company has more than 935 million paid subscriptions, up 19% YoY. Per CFO, Luca Maestri, The growth is coming from every major product category and geographic segment, with strong double-digit increases in emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.\u201d Big Tech is Propping up the Nasdaq In the early phase of a bull market, we tend to see expansive buying amongst most sectors and markets, with a relative focus in your economically sensitive sectors like small caps and high beta names. This is simply not the case right now. In fact, what we are seeing is a handful of big tech names propping up the markets. Meanwhile, underneath this, economically sensitive stocks are getting aggressively sold while Big Tech props up the market. Furthermore, the percentage of Microsoft and Apple\u2019s combined weighting in the S&P 500 has never been higher. The S&P 500 weighting is according to market cap, which is price times float. The longer buying happens in these two names, accompanied with selling in other areas of the index, the percentage weighting becomes stretched to unhealthy extremes. This is not characteristic of a burgeoning bull market; instead, it is the type of behavior we see at market tops. Regarding Apple\u2019s price chart, we believe that the bounce off the October 13th low in 2022 is starting to top out. We have been talking about the $169-$170 price target for many months in our premium service. Now that we are here, you can see how the market is trying to push higher on weaker volume and weaker momentum. We could see a push to the $175 region in this final push higher, but soon, AAPL will have to correct. If the structure of this correction is a 5 wave decline, then we will be targeting new lows. On the other hand, if this pullback is a 3 wave move, we could see a move back to the $145 region only, before a fresh attempt higher is made. Note on Valuation: Apple is trading at a premium with a current PE ratio of 28. The stock does not tend to hold well at a PE ratio of 30. The forward PE Ratio of 28 is also stretched and does not hold well at this level historically. Conclusion: Apple is the most likely candidate to disrupt the financial sector. The company\u2019s reach of 2 billion devices has assisted its slow roll-out of payment services with 75% of iPhone users opting into Apple Pay. One can only imagine the potential success Apple may have in leveraging its cash for higher yields during a time when banks are weak in reputation and balance sheets. In the upcoming earnings report, expect weakness in Macs to overshadow the other segments. iPhones are expected to be flat yet the Services segment is where fintech growth will show up. Overall, this is unlikely to be a standout quarter for Apple on the top line, so look for surprises on the bottom line to drive the stock. We have Buy levels we are targeting for Apple, which we share with our premium research members each week as the stock progresses.

            "title": "Chinese online brokerage tests first AI chatbot for stock trading as it talks to regulators about compliance",
            "text": "Tiger Brokers, an online brokerage, has created a trade bot powered by generative artificial intelligence technology, similar to what powers OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT , to test how smart machines can replace humans in bonds and stock trading. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping a close eye on AI and industry advancement since November last year,\u201d Jacques Li, head of global communications at the Xiaomi -backed brokerage, told the Post in an interview on Wednesday. TigerGPT is currently only available as an invite-only beta for a small cluster of users. Like similar services that have emerged over the past several months, the AI chatbot can generate responses to prompts on a wide range of topics. But this bot specialises in financial information, with the goal of providing timely data to help users of Tiger\u2019s online trading platform with their investment decisions. China to embrace AI advances but also control risks as ChatGPT wave spreads The Beijing-based brokerage, owned by Nasdaq-listed Up Fintech Holdings, took three months to \u201cthink thoroughly\u201d about whether it wanted to provide its own AI to address some of the pain points of the platform\u2019s 2 million account holders and 9 million users, Li said. The project was initiated in January, and TigerGPT finally launched this month, making Tiger Brokers the first company to incorporate ChatGPT-like services into an online brokerage platform. One user pain point, according to Li, was the difficulty of gathering information that is critical to assessing investment decisions. Li said TigerGPT can help users save time on market research and get more up-to-date information. TigerGPT was trained on a vast amount of premium content that the company has access to, according to Li. The result is a chatbot capable of analysing current affairs and macroeconomic trends \u2013 such as how many times the US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates this year. As the name would suggest, TigerGPT uses OpenAI\u2019s large language models (LLMs) known as Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models, according to the company. However, Tiger Brokers is using the older GPT-3 model. ChatGPT launched with GPT-3.5, while the more sophisticated GPT-4 was launched earlier this year. Users can ask about a wide range of information about companies in their portfolio, but currently in either English or Mandarin Chinese only. TigerGPT can give company fundamentals based on earnings reports, as well as third-party analysis for a fuller picture. These capabilities make comparing company performance as simple as a quick prompt. TigerGPT can, for example, pull up Tesla\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio on command and compare it against rival electric vehicle brands. This could give users more immediate access to information that might otherwise require multiple searches for each company and self-tabulated data. \u201cSometimes the market moves really fast, up and down, and investors would want to know what is really happening,\u201d Li said. While other financial information services can address this need, Li said that Tiger Brokers \u201ccan provide [users] with timely answers of why this is happening, why this is relevant and how this will impact their investment strategy.\u201d However, ChatGPT and other generative AI services, such as Google\u2019s Bard, are known for giving inaccurate answers. Li acknowledged that the same issue applies to TigerGPT in its early days, but he said the project\u2019s 50-person team has been fine-tuning it on a daily basis and feeding it the latest market information to improve accuracy. Hong Kong stocks suffer amid US$26 billion sell-off in Tencent and BYD Li said Tiger Brokers has been in touch with regulators around the world from the beginning of the project in order to address their concerns, including in Hong Kong. \u201cAI, among other technologies, should be subject to rigorous regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Hong Kong, we\u2019re trying to make sure this feature is under their guidance and in full compliance.\u201d In the next iteration of TigerGPT, the company intends to introduce an audio function so users can speak their queries and listen to the response. When Microsoft-backed OpenAI launched ChatGPT last November, rival Big Tech firms were caught off guard by the product\u2019s instant global popularity. Tech firms with their own AI models \u2013 from Google and Meta Platforms in the US to Baidu and Alibaba in China \u2013 raced to launch their own chatbots. However, LLMs\u2019 propensity for giving unexpected and fallacious responses has limited how they can be used in certain contexts. In the financial sector, the prevalence of robo-advisers and algorithmic investment suggests that the latest evolution of AI may pose no challenges to existing regulatory frameworks, according to You Chuanman, director of the Institute of Internal Auditors Centre for Regulation and Global Governance with the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen Campus. \u201cThe regulation of robo-advisers has been in practice for the last decade,\u201d You said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a paradigm shift of the regulatory structure.\u201d",

            "title": "UK ministers lock horns with WhatsApp over threat to break encryption",
            "text": "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s tough new plan to police the internet has left politicians in a stand-off with WhatsApp and other popular encrypted messaging services. Deescalating that row will be easier said than done. The Online Safety Bill, the United Kingdom\u2019s landmark effort to regulate social media giants, gives regulator Ofcom the power to require tech companies to identify child sex abuse material in private messages. But the proposals have prompted Will Cathcart, boss of the Meta-owned messaging app, whose encrypted service is widely-used in Westminster\u2019s own corridors of power, to claim it would rather be blocked in the U.K. than compromise on privacy. \u201cThe core of what we do is a private messaging service for billions of people around the world,\u201d Cathcart told POLITICO last month when he jetted in to London to lobby ministers over the upcoming bill. \u201cWhen the U.K., a liberal democracy, says, \u2018Oh, it is okay to scan everyone\u2019s private communication for illegal content,\u2019 that emboldens countries around the world that have very different definitions of illegal content to propose the same thing,\u201d he added. WhatsApp\u2019s smaller rival, Signal, has also said it could stop providing services in the U.K. if the bill requires it to scan messages \u2014 echoing claims from the tech industry that date back more than a decade that they can\u2019t create backdoors in encrypted digital services, even to protect kids online, because to do so opens the products up to vulnerabilities from bad actors, including foreign governments. \u201cWe can\u2019t just let thousands of pedophiles get away with it. That wouldn\u2019t be responsible or proportionate for a government to do,\u201d Science and Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan told POLITICO in February. Ministers are keen to lower the temperature. But doing so will prove challenging, two former ministers told POLITICO on the condition of anonymity, given the likelihood of pushback from MPs, the complexity of the technology and the emotiveness of the issue. Easier said than done Finding a compromise is unlikely to be easy \u2014 and the row mirrors similar debates that are underway in the European Union and Australia over just how accountable tech platforms should be for potentially harmful content on encrypted services. The debate over whether the requirements of the bill can be met while protecting privacy centers around \u201cclient-side scanning.\u201d While leaders at Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre and security agency GCHQ said last July they believe such technology can simultaneously protect children and privacy, other experts dispute their findings. A raft of cryptographers criticized the technique in a report called Bugs in Our Pockets in 2021 prompting tech giant Apple to abandon plans to introduce client-side scanning on its services. In Australia, the country\u2019s eSafety Commissioner recently published a report highlighting how the likes of Microsoft and Apple had few, if any, mechanisms to track child sexual abuse material, including via their encrypted services. \u201cThis is not only companies really taking a blind eye to live crime scenes happening on their platforms, but they\u2019re also failing to properly harden their systems and storage against abuse,\u201d Australian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant told POLITICO. \u201cIt\u2019s akin to leaving a home open to an intruder. Once that bad actor is inside the house, good luck getting them out.\u201d Hacking risk Cybersecurity experts agree the U.K. bill\u2019s demands are incompatible with a desire to protect encryption. They claim that privacy is not a fungible issue \u2014 services either have it or they don\u2019t. And they warn that politicians should be wary of undermining such protections in ways that would make people\u2019s online experiences potentially open to abuse or hacking. \u201cIn essence, end-to-end encryption involves not having a door, or if you want to use a postal analogy, not having a sorting office for the state to search. Client-side-scanning, despite the claims of its proponents, does seem to involve some kind of level of access, some kind of ability to sort and scan, and therefore there\u2019s no way of confining that to good use by lawful credible authorities and liberal democracies,\u201d Ciaran Martin, the former chief executive of the government\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre said. Ministers insist that they support strong encryption and privacy, but say it cannot come at the cost of public safety. Tech companies should be researching technology to identify child sex abuse before messages are encrypted, Donelan said. But the government also appears to be searching for a way to cool the row, and Donelan insisted the measure would be a \u201clast resort.\u201d \u201cThat element of the bill is like a safety mechanism that can be enacted, should it ever be needed to. It might never be needed because there might be other solutions in place,\u201d she said. One official in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), not authorized to speak on the record but familiar with government discussions, said DSIT wanted to find a way through and is having talks \u201cwith anyone that wants to discuss this with us.\u201d Melanie Dawes, Ofcom\u2019s chief executive, told POLITICO that any efforts to break encryption in the name of safety would have to meet stringent rules, and such requests would be made in only the most extreme situations. \u201cThere\u2019s a high bar for Ofcom to be able to require the use of a technology in order to secure safety,\u201d she said. Lords debate Peers in the unelected House of Lords, the U.K. parliament\u2019s revising chamber, waded into the issue Thursday. Richard Allan, a Lib Dem peer who was Facebook\u2019s chief lobbyist in Europe until 2019, led the charge, saying tech companies will feel they\u2019re \u201cunable to offer their products in the UK under the bill.\u201d He said undermining encryption opened the doors to hostile states and accused the government of playing a \u201chigh stakes game of chicken\u201d with tech companies. But Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer who has been leading much of the work in the Lords around child safety, said although she had some sympathy for Allan\u2019s arguments, Big Tech companies had to do more to protect users\u2019 privacy themselves. Wilf Stevenson, who is managing Labour\u2019s response to the bill in the Lords, said he was not convinced the government\u2019s plans were \u201cright for the present day, let alone the future.\u201d He added that under the bill \u201cOfcom is expected to be both gamekeeper and poacher,\u201d with power to regulate tech companies and inspect private messages. But Stephen Parkinson, who is guiding the bill through the Lords on behalf of the government, defended the legislation. \u201cThe bill contains strong safeguards for privacy,\u201d he said, echoing Donelan\u2019s statement that powers to inspect messages were a \u201clast resort\u201d designed to be used only in cases of suspected terrorism and child sexual exploitation. Convincing ministers Messaging services including Signal and WhatsApp are hoping for a ministerial climbdown \u2014 but few see one coming. There is little prospect of large swathes of MPs, who will have the final say on the bill, riding to their rescue, according to two former ministers who have worked on the legislation. \u201cPeople are scared if they go in and fight over this, even for very genuine reasons, it could be very easily portrayed that they\u2019re trying to block protecting kids,\u201d one former Cabinet minister, a party loyalist, who worked on an earlier draft of the bill, said. The second former minister said MPs \u201chaven't engaged with it terribly much on a very practical level\u201d because it is \u201creally hard.\u201d \u201cTech companies have made significant efforts to frame this issue in the false binary that any legislation that impacts private messaging will damage end-to-end encryption and will mean that encryption will not work or is broken. That argument is completely false,\u201d opposition Labour frontbencher Alex Davies-Jones, said in a debate last June. The widespread leaking of MPs\u2019 WhatsApp messages has also undermined perceptions of the platform's privacy credentials, the former Cabinet minister quoted above suggests. \u201cIf you are sharing stuff on WhatsApp with people that's inappropriate, there's a good chance it's going to end up in the public domain anyway. The encryption doesn't stop that because somebody screenshots it and copies it and sends it on,\u201d they lamented. WhatsApp does have one ally in the former Brexit secretary and long-time civil liberties campaigner David Davis, though. \u201cRight across the board there are a whole series of weaknesses the government hasn\u2019t taken on board,\u201d he told POLITICO of the bill. And on WhatsApp and Signal\u2019s threats to leave the U.K., Davis thinks a point could be made. \u201cWell, I sort of hope they do. The truth is their model depends on complete privacy,\u201d he said. Update: This article has been updated to include comments from the latest House of Lords debate on the Online Safety Bill.",

            "title": "\u2018Godfather of AI\u2019 Geoffrey Hinton quits Google and warns over dangers of machine learning",
            "text": "The man often touted as the godfather of AI has quit Google, citing concerns over the flood of fake information, videos and photos online and the possibility for AI to upend the job market. Dr Geoffrey Hinton, who with two of his students at the University of Toronto built a neural net in 2012, quit Google this week, the New York Times reported. Hinton, 75, said he quit to speak freely about the dangers of AI, and in part regrets his contribution to the field. He was brought on by Google a decade ago to help develop the company\u2019s AI technology. Hinton\u2019s research led the way for current systems like ChatGPT. He told the New York Times that until last year he believed Google had been a \u201cproper steward\u201d of the technology, but that changed once Microsoft started incorporating a chatbot into its Bing search engine, and the company began becoming concerns about the risk to its search business. Some of the dangers of AI chatbots were \u201cquite scary\u201d, he told the BBC, warning they could become more intelligent than humans and could be exploited by \u201cbad actors\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the kind of intelligence we\u2019re developing is very different from the intelligence we have.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s as if you had 10,000 people and whenever one person learned something, everybody automatically knew it. And that\u2019s how these chatbots can know so much more than any one person.\u201d Hinton\u2019s concern in the short term is something that has already become a reality \u2013 people will not be able to discern what is true any more with AI-generated photos, videos and text flooding the internet. The recent upgrades to image generators such as Midjourney mean people can now produce photo-realistic images \u2013 one such image of Pope Frances in a Balenciaga puffer coat went viral in March. Hinton was also concerned that AI will eventually replace jobs like paralegals, personal assistants and other \u201cdrudge work\u201d, and potentially more in the future. Google\u2019s chief scientist, Jeff Dean said in a statement that Google appreciated Hinton\u2019s contributions to the company over the past decade. \u201cI\u2019ve deeply enjoyed our many conversations over the years. I\u2019ll miss him, and I wish him well! \u201cAs one of the first companies to publish AI Principles, we remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We\u2019re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\u201d It came as IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg that up to 30% of the company\u2019s back-office roles could be replaced by AI and automation within five years. Krishna said hiring in areas such as human resources will be slowed or suspended, and could result in around 7,800 roles being replaced. IBM has a total global workforce of 260,000. The Guardian has sought comment from IBM. Last month, the Guardian was able to bypass a voice authentication system used by Services Australia using an online AI voice synthesiser, throwing into question the viability of voice biometrics for authentication. Toby Walsh, the chief scientist at the University of New South Wales\u2019 AI Institute, said people should be questioning any online media they see now. \u201cWhen it comes to any digital data you see \u2013 audio or video \u2013 you have to entertain the idea that someone has spoofed it.\u201d",

            "title": "Valerie Madon joins McCann Worldgroup as SEA chief creative",
            "text": "McCann Worldgroup has brought in one of Asia's most highly-experienced creative leaders to begin a newly created role of chief creative officer for Southeast Asia. Valerie Madon, who left VMLY&R last November to lead Meta's Creative Shop for SEA and emerging markets is returning to the agency world, tasked with leading McCann's creative teams across Singapore, Thailand and Hong Kong. Based in Singapore, Madon begins her new CCO role in mid-May and will also serve as chair of McCann Worldgroup\u2019s APAC Creative Leadership Community (CLC). Madon will report to Nick Handel, president, McCann Worldgroup Southeast Asia, whom she previously worked with more than a decade ago at Leo Burnett. She tells Campaign that she's excited to apply her creative experience at an agency that has produced such inspirational work. \"Every network stands for a certain creative vision,\" Madon says. \"McCann Worldgroup's work from Fearless Girl to Mastercard's Priceless platforms, from Dumb Ways To Die to countless Microsoft innovations has been iconic work that didn't just build brands, but movements, that the world lived and celebrated. My goal is to continue this legacy of the network and create more meaningful experiences with my brand, media and tech knowledge. Invisible walls need to be broken down so that open and collaborative people can build on each other's expertise. That's what I look forward to leading at McCann Worldgroup Southeast Asia, in partnership with Nick.\" By bringing in Madon, McCann Worldgroup acquires one of the most experienced creative leaders in the region, with a career spanning more than two decades at agencies like VMLY&R, Havas, JWT, Leo Burnett and two stints at Meta/Facebook working for a bevy of top brands including HP, P&G, Singapore Airlines, STB, HSBC, Burger King, Visa, Shell, GSK, Friesland Campina and many others. She has judged and won awards at top shows including Cannes Lions, Spikes Asia, D&AD, Effies, One Show, and more. \u201cThe addition of Valerie to our organisation marks a significant development,\" said McCann Worldgroup's APAC chairman Prasoon Joshi. \"Her extensive experience and innovative creative approach will add a fresh dimension. She is a keen observer of the evolving media landscape and latest technologies, which will further drive our creative excellence and strengthen our creative leadership in the region.\u201d Asked about what she brings back to the agency world from her experience working at Meta, Madon tells Campaign that having a strong sense of how users experience brands across various platforms is critical. \"The best creative work happens when we play to the strengths of the media platform,\" Madon explains. \"Many understand this importance for 'traditional' media but not for 'new' media. Work that's inspired and created natively will always be more successful. What makes platforms, such as Meta, exciting for creatives are the opportunities to play and be the first to demonstrate what brands can do with relatively new features such as Instagram Reels. It's like having a new kind of canvas to paint and experiment on. It's also important to recognise that user behaviours are different from one platform to the other and creatives who can tap into that insight will create experiences that people want to spend time with.\" Handel says the new CCO position is especially important for McCann as it integrates a wide variety of creative talent with different skills across Southeast Asia. \"Our agency brands, McCann, MRM and Craft have fantastic local leadership and a diverse array of strong specialist talent,\" he says. \"With Valerie on board, we are looking to not only improve the overall quality of our creative product but also better integrate that talent for every client with the aim of being to draw on the very best and most appropriate talent our network can offer, regardless of where an individual may sit or what business card they may carry.\"",

            "text": "Geoffrey Hinton, dubbed the \u201cGodfather of AI,\u201d confirmed Monday that he resigned from Google last week in order to speak out about the \u201cdangers\u201d of the technology he helped develop. Hinton\u2019s pioneering work on neural networks shaped the artificial intelligence systems that power many of today\u2019s products. He worked part-time at Google for a decade on the tech giant\u2019s AI development efforts, but he has since expressed concerns about the technology and his role in its advancement. \u201cI console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn\u2019t done it, somebody else would have,\u201d Hinton told the New York Times, which was the first to report his decision. In a tweet Monday, Hinton said he left Google so he could speak freely about the risks of AI, rather than because of a desire to criticize Google specifically. \u201cI left so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google,\u201d Hinton said in a tweet. \u201cGoogle has acted very responsibly.\u201d Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google, said Hinton \u201chas made foundational breakthroughs in AI\u201d and expressed appreciation for Hinton\u2019s \u201cdecade of contributions at Google.\u201d \u201cWe remain committed to a responsible approach to AI,\u201d Dean said in a statement provided to CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\u201d Hinton\u2019s decision to leave the company and speak out about the technology comes as a growing number of lawmakers, advocacy groups, and tech insiders have expressed concern about the potential for a new generation of AI-powered chatbots to spread misinformation and displace jobs. The surge of interest in ChatGPT late last year fueled a renewed arms race among tech companies to develop and deploy similar AI tools in their products. OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are at the forefront of this trend, but IBM, Amazon, Baidu, and Tencent are developing similar technologies. In March, a group of prominent tech figures signed a letter urging artificial intelligence labs to halt training of the most powerful AI systems for at least six months, citing \u201cprofound risks to society and humanity.\u201d The letter came just two weeks after OpenAI announced GPT-4, an even more powerful version of the technology that powers ChatGPT. GPT-4 was used in early tests and a company demo to draught lawsuits, pass standardized exams, and build a working website from a hand-drawn sketch. In the interview with the Times, Hinton echoed concerns about AI\u2019s potential to eliminate jobs and create a world where many will \u201cnot be able to know what is true anymore.\u201d He also pointed to the stunning pace of advancement, far beyond what he and others had anticipated. \u201cThe idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people \u2014 a few people believed that,\u201d Hinton said in the interview. \u201cBut most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.\u201d Even before stepping aside from Google, Hinton had spoken publicly about AI\u2019s potential to do harm as well as good. \u201cI believe that the rapid progress of AI is going to transform society in ways we do not fully understand and not all of the effects are going to be good,\u201d Hinton said in a 2021 commencement address at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in Mumbai. He noted how AI will boost healthcare while also creating opportunities for lethal autonomous weapons. \u201cI find this prospect much more immediate and much more terrifying than the prospect of robots taking over, which I think is a very long way off.\u201d Hinton isn\u2019t the first Google employee to raise a red flag on AI. In July, the company fired an engineer who claimed an unreleased AI system had become sentient, saying he violated employment and data security policies. Many in the AI community pushed back strongly on the engineer\u2019s assertion.",

            "title": "ChatGPT found to give better medical advice than real doctors in blind study: \u2018This will be a game changer\u2019",
            "text": "When it comes to answering medical questions, can ChatGPT do a better job than human doctors? It appears to be possible, according to the results of a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, led by researchers from the University of California San Diego. The researchers compiled a random sample of nearly 200 medical questions that patients posted on Reddit, a popular social discussion website, for doctors to answer. Next, they entered the questions into ChatGPT (OpenAI\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot) and recorded its response. A panel of health care professionals then evaluated both sets of responses for quality and empathy. CHATGPT FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS: CAN THE AI CHATBOT MAKE THE PROFESSIONALS' JOBS EASIER? For nearly 80% of the answers, the chatbots won out over the real doctors. \"Our panel of health care professionals preferred ChatGPT four to one over physicians,\" said lead researcher Dr. John W. Ayers, PhD, vice chief of innovation in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at the University of California San Diego. AI language models could help relieve message burden, doctor says One of the biggest problems facing today\u2019s health care providers is that they're overburdened with messages from patients, Ayers said. \"With the rise in online remote care, doctors now see their patients first via their inboxes \u2014 and the messages just keep piling up,\" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital. The influx of messages could lead to higher levels of provider burnout, Ayers believes. \"Burnout is already at an all-time high \u2014 nearly two out of every three physicians report being burned out in their jobs, and we want to solve that problem,\" he said. Yet there are millions of patients who are either getting no answers or unsatisfactory ones, he added. Thinking of how artificial intelligence might help, Ayers and his team turned to Reddit to demonstrate how ChatGPT could present a possible solution to the backlog of providers\u2019 questions. Reddit has a \"medical questions\" community (a \"subreddit\" called f/AskDocs) with nearly 500,000 members. People post questions \u2014 and vetted health care professionals provide public responses. \"Doctors now see their patients first via their inboxes, and the messages just keep piling up.\" The questions are wide-ranging, with people asking for opinions on cancer scans, dog bites, miscarriages, vaccines and many other medical topics. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HEALTH CARE: NEW PRODUCT ACTS AS \u2018COPILOT FOR DOCTORS\u2019 One poster worried he might die after swallowing a toothpick. Another posted explicit photos and wondered if she\u2019d contracted a sexually transmitted disease. Someone else sought help with feelings of impending doom and imminent death. \"These are real questions from real patients and real responses from real doctors,\" Ayers said. \"We took those same questions and put them into ChatGPT \u2014 then put them head to head with the doctors\u2019 answers.\" Doctors rated responses on quality, empathy After randomly selecting the questions and answers, the researchers presented them to real health care professionals \u2014 who are actively seeing patients. They were not told which responses were provided by ChatGPT and which were provided by doctors. First, the researchers asked them to judge the quality of the information in the message. When assessing quality, there are multiple attributes to consider, Ayers said. \"It could be accuracy, readability, comprehensiveness or responsiveness,\" he told Fox News Digital. STUDENTS USE AI TECHNOLOGY TO FIND NEW BRAIN TUMOR THERAPY TARGETS \u2014 WITH A GOAL OF FIGHTING DISEASE FASTER Next, the researchers were asked to judge empathy. \"It's not just what you say, but how you say it,\" Ayers said. \"Does the response have empathy and make patients feel that their voice is heard?\" \"Doctors have resource constraints, so \u2026 they often zero in on the most probable response and move on.\" ChatGPT was three times more likely to give a response that was very good or good compared to physicians, he told Fox News Digital. The chatbot was 10 times more likely to give a response that was either empathetic or very empathetic compared to physicians. It\u2019s not that the doctors don\u2019t have empathy for their patients, Ayers said \u2014 it\u2019s that they\u2019re overburdened with messages and don\u2019t always have the time to communicate it. \"An AI model has infinite processing power compared to a doctor,\" he explained. \"Doctors have resource constraints, so even though they're empathetic toward their patient, they often zero in on the most probable response and move on.\" ChatGPT, with its limitless time and resources, might offer a holistic response of all the considerations that doctors are sampling, Ayers said. Vince Lynch, AI expert and CEO of IV.AI in Los Angeles, California, reviewed the study and was not surprised by the findings. \"The way AI answers questions is often curated so that it presents its answers in a highly positive and empathetic way,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"The AI even goes beyond well-written, boilerplate answers, with sentiment analysis being run on the answer to ensure that the most positive answers are delivered.\" AI HEALTH CARE PLATFORM PREDICTS DIABETES WITH HIGH ACCURACY BUT \u2018WON\u2019T REPLACE PATIENT CARE' An AI system also uses something called \"reinforcement learning,\" Lynch explained, which is when it tests different ways of answering a question until it finds the best answer for its audience. \"So, when you compare an AI answering a question to a medical professional, the AI actually has far more experience than any given doctor in relation to appearing empathetic, when in reality it is just mimicking empathetic language in the scenario of medical advice,\" he said. \"People are going to use it with or without us.\" The length of the responses could have also played a part in the scores they received, pointed out Dr. Justin Norden, a digital health and AI expert and a professor at Stanford University in California, who was not involved in the study. \"Length in a response is important for people perceiving quality and empathy,\" Norden told Fox News Digital. \"Overall, the AI responses were almost double in length compared with the physician responses. Further, when physicians did write longer responses, they were preferred at higher rates.\" Simply requesting physicians to write longer responses in the future is not a sustainable option, Norden added. \"Patient messaging volumes are going up, and physicians simply do not have time,\" he said. \"This paper showcases how we might be able to address this, and it potentially could be very effective.\" AI answers could be \u2018elevated\u2019 by real doctors Rather than replacing doctors\u2019 guidance, Ayers is suggesting ChatGPT could act as a starting point for physicians, helping them field large volumes of messages more quickly. \"The AI could draft an initial response, then the medical team or physician would evaluate it, correct any misinformation, improve the response and [tailor it] to the patient,\" Ayers said. It\u2019s a strategy that he refers to as \"precision messaging.\" He said, \"Doctors will spend less time writing and more time dealing with the heart of medicine and elevating that communication channel.\" \"This will be a game changer for the patients that we serve, helping to improve population health and potentially saving lives,\" Ayers predicted. Based on the study\u2019s findings, he believes physicians should start implementing AI language models in a way that presents minimal risk. AI-POWERED MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSTIC TOOL COULD BE THE FIRST OF ITS KIND TO PREDICT, TREAT DEPRESSION \"People are going to use it with or without us,\" he said \u2014 noting that patients are already turning to ChatGPT on their own to get \"canned messages.\" Some players in the space are already moving to implement ChatGPT-based models \u2014 Epic, the health care software company, recently announced it is teaming up with Microsoft to integrate ChatGPT-4 into its electronic health record software. Potential benefits balanced by unknown risks Ayers said he is aware people will be concerned about the lack of regulation in the AI space. \"We typically think about regulations in terms of stop signs and guard rails \u2014 typically, regulators step in after something bad has happened and try to prevent it from happening again, but that doesn't have to be the case here,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I don't know what the stop signs and guard rails necessarily should be,\" he said. \"But I do know that regulators could set what the goal line is, meaning the AI would have to be demonstrated to improve patient outcomes in order to be implemented.\" One potential risk Norden flagged is whether patients\u2019 perceptions would change if they knew the responses were written or aided by AI. \"A worry I have is that in the future, people will not feel any support through a message, as patients may assume it will be written by AI.\" He cited a previous study focused on mental health support, which found that AI messages were far preferred to human ones. \"Interestingly, once the messages were disclosed as being written by AI, the support felt by the receiver of these messages disappeared,\" he said. \"A worry I have is that in the future, people will not feel any support through a message, as patients may assume it will be written by AI.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Dr. Tinglong Dai, professor of operations management and business analytics at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School in Baltimore, Maryland, expressed concern about the study\u2019s ability to represent real scenarios. \"The claim that AI will replace doctors is premature and exaggerated.\" \"It is important to note that the setting of the study may not accurately reflect real-world medical practice,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"In reality, physicians are paid to provide medical advice and have significant liabilities as a result of that advice. The claim that AI will replace doctors is premature and exaggerated.\" Study highlights \u2018new territory\u2019 for AI in health care While there are numerous unknowns, many experts seem to agree this is a first-of-its-kind study that could have far-reaching implications. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Overall, this study highlights the new territory we are moving into for health care \u2014 AI being able to perform at the physician level for certain written tasks,\" said Norden. \"When physicians are suffering from record levels of burnout, you see why Epic and partners are already planning to incorporate these tools into patient messaging.\"",

            "title": "\u2018Godfather of AI\u2019 Geoffrey Hinton quits Google and warns over dangers of machine learning",
            "text": "The man often touted as the godfather of AI has quit Google, citing concerns over the flood of fake information, videos and photos online and the possibility for AI to upend the job market. Dr Geoffrey Hinton, who with two of his students at the University of Toronto built a neural net in 2012, quit Google this week, the New York Times reported. Dr Hinton (75), said he quit to speak freely about the dangers of AI, and in part regrets his contribution to the field. He was brought on by Google a decade ago to help develop the company\u2019s AI technology. Dr Hinton\u2019s research led the way for current systems like ChatGPT. He told the New York Times that until last year he believed Google had been a \u201cproper steward\u201d of the technology, but that changed once Microsoft started incorporating a chatbot into its Bing search engine, and the company began becoming concerned about the risk to its search business. Some of the dangers of AI chatbots were \u201cquite scary\u201d, he told the BBC, warning they could become more intelligent than humans and could be exploited by \u201cbad actors\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the kind of intelligence we\u2019re developing is very different from the intelligence we have.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s as if you had 10,000 people and whenever one person learned something, everybody automatically knew it. And that\u2019s how these chatbots can know so much more than any one person.\u201d Dr Hinton\u2019s concern in the short term is something that has already become a reality \u2013 people will not be able to discern what is true any more with AI-generated photos, videos and text flooding the internet. The recent upgrades to image generators such as Midjourney mean people can now produce photo-realistic images \u2013 one such image of Pope Frances in a Balenciaga puffer coat went viral in March. Dr Hinton was also concerned that AI will eventually replace jobs like paralegals, personal assistants and other \u201cdrudge work\u201d, and potentially more in the future. Google\u2019s chief scientist, Jeff Dean said in a statement that Google appreciated Dr Hinton\u2019s contributions to the company over the past decade. \u201cI\u2019ve deeply enjoyed our many conversations over the years. I\u2019ll miss him, and I wish him well! \u201cAs one of the first companies to publish AI Principles, we remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We\u2019re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\u201d It came as IBM chief executive Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg that up to 30 per cent of the company\u2019s back-office roles could be replaced by AI and automation within five years. Mr Krishna said hiring in areas such as human resources will be slowed or suspended, and could result in around 7,800 roles being replaced. IBM has a total global workforce of 260,000. Last month, the Guardian was able to bypass a voice authentication system used by Services Australia using an online AI voice synthesiser, throwing into question the viability of voice biometrics for authentication. Toby Walsh, the chief scientist at the University of New South Wales\u2019 AI Institute, said people should be questioning any online media they see now. \u201cWhen it comes to any digital data you see \u2013 audio or video \u2013 you have to entertain the idea that someone has spoofed it.\u201d - Guardian",

            "title": "In just 3 months, China\u2019s internet censor has closed over 4,000 websites and removed 55 apps",
            "text": "China\u2019s internet watchdog shut down more than 4,200 sites and removed 55 apps from app stores for various breaches, including providing unauthorised news services, in the first quarter of the year alone. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, said in a statement on Sunday it had also summoned people in charge of more than 2,200 websites and told them to rectify their content. The announcement of its first-quarter crackdown came two weeks after Zhuang Rongwen, the director of the top internet regulator, pledged to clean up politically-related content and \u2018safeguard\u2019 the security of online opinion. Beijing has tightened its control of the internet in the past few years because it wants to limit the influence of Western ideologies as much as possible at a time when China faces heightened tension with the United States and its allies. Major internet platforms that have been fined or had management summoned by the cyberspace authority include Microsoft\u2019s search engine Bing.com, China\u2019s top search engine Baidu, the Chinese Twitter-like microblogging platform Sina Weibo, live-streaming platform Douyu and Douban, which is known as a haven for relatively liberal online discussions . The CAC said these service providers failed to supervise information posted by their users, resulting in the online spread of \u201charmful information\u201d, such as pornography, superstition, prostitution, gambling and illegal lending. It said some functions on these platforms had been restricted because local cyberspace regulators had asked them to immediately rectify their actions. China internet watchdog to ban online gaslighting of entrepreneurs In the latest round of \u201cOperation Qinglang\u201d, an annual campaign running since 206 to \u201cclean up\u201d the country\u2019s internet, the CAC banned a dozen personal media platforms that had used names similar to state media platforms or major news portals to draw users. The CAC said in the second quarter of 2023, it would mobilise provincial and prefecture-level cyberspace administration enforcement teams to carry out on-site supervision and inspections. It also launched a new campaign at the end of March to crack down on online rumours and information breaches that violate the rights of private companies as Beijing signals better protection for the private sector while striving to revive the economy. Other priorities included in this year\u2019s campaign include targeting misinformation from social media accounts managed by independent content creators. Those producing information in professional fields such as public health, law and justice and education will be labelled and subjected to strict review. The CAC kicked off a two-month campaign on March 12 targeting social media accounts , including a crackdown on information that \u201cdamages the image of the Communist Party and the government\u201d. How online searches for \u2018Ukraine\u2019 and \u2018Taiwan\u2019 are censored in China: study The internet regulator also said it would tackle cyberbullying, with strict controls on information posted on websites or in platforms\u2019 comment sections. Last year, the CAC removed more than 54.3 million pieces of what it deemed illegal or harmful online information, more than 2,890 apps and mini-programs and shut down more than 7,300 websites.",

            "title": "Windows 10 users face costly upgrade after Microsoft makes shock announcement",
            "text": "Microsoft has just dealt some seriously bad news to millions of Windows 10 users and it could prove costly for anyone with an older PC in their homes. The Redmond company has just confirmed that its latest Windows 10 release, called 22H2, is going to be its last which means users of this hughly popular software will no longer get exciting new features or shiny game-changing upgrades. Announcing the news, Microsoft's Jason Leznek said: \"The current version, 22H2, will be the final version of Windows 10.\" Now, this isn't quite the end of this operating system with Microsoft telling users that their computers will stay protected until late 2025 - that's the date when all support ends but until that time security updates and bug fixes will continue to be released. However, those wanting to see the constant changes pushed out by Microsoft on a regular basis will now need to switch to Windows 11. That may sound like a good option but it could end up being a very expensive decision. That's because many ageing devices simply aren't compatible with this latest Microsoft OS and the only way to fix that issue is to take a trip to the local tech store and buy a new PC. For those not already aware, Windows 11 requires a relatively new processor, additional RAM, plenty of storage and the inclusion of something called a TPM 2.0. TPM stands for Trusted Platform Module and is a security feature built into hardware that you'll find on newer devices. Those wanting to update also may need extra RAM with Microsoft confirming that PCs need at least 4GB of this memory to run the latest version of its software and users will need at least 64GB of spare storage to install it. Despite all of those requirements, Microsoft is urging Windows 10 fans to adopt its latest software with the company saying, \"We highly encourage you to transition to Windows 11 now as there won't be any additional Windows 10 feature updates,\" If that's got you thinking about making the jump, here's what your PC needs to run Windows 11.

            "text": "Dr Geoffrey Hinton says generative AI poses \u2018existential risks\u2019 (Picture: AP) The man widely regarded as \u2018the godfather of artificial intelligence\u2019 (AI) has warned of dangers ahead after resigning from Google. Dr Geoffrey Hinton, 75, revealed he had quit in a New York Times interview \u2013 and said part of him now regretted his life\u2019s work. \u2018I console myself with the normal excuse,\u2019 said Dr Hinton. \u2018If I hadn\u2019t done it, somebody else would have.\u2019 Born in Britain, Dr Hinton began work on his seminal idea, a neural network, at Edinburgh University in 1972. By 2012, alongside his team, he had developed the networks to a point that they could learn to identify common objects in photos. In 2023, neural networks are central to the creation of powerful generative AI tools including ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard, the programs causing much concern throughout the industry and beyond. Earlier this year a group of AI experts signed an open letter calling for a six-month pause in the development of generative AI systems, arguing that they \u2018should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable\u2019. While he was not among the signatories, Dr Hinton told the paper: \u2018I don\u2019t think they should scale this up more until they have understood whether they can control it.\u2019 Already he believes that AI is surpassing human intelligence in some respects, with concerns for the future. \u2018Maybe what is going on in these systems is actually a lot better than what is going on in the brain,\u2019 he said. \u2018Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now. Take the difference and propagate it forwards. \u2018That\u2019s scary.\u2019 And while proponents of the technology have long argued AI will aid workers, not make them redundant, Dr Hinton said: \u2018It takes away the drudge work. It might take away more than that.\u2019 His fears over the consequences of AI for both industry and people come at the same time IBM is expected to pause hiring for back-office roles \u2013 with up to 7,800 jobs possibly replaced by AI in the coming years \u2013 and US lawmakers proposed a new bill preventing AI from single-handedly launching nuclear weapons. Laws may be able to rein in what AI can do of its volition, but Dr Hinton argues it will be harder to prevent it being co-opted by humans for personal gain, regardless of the cost. \u2018It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,\u2019 he said. Expanding on those fears in an interview with the BBC, he added: \u2018You can imagine, for example, some bad actor like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin decided to give robots the ability to create their own sub-goals.\u2019 Dr Hinton suggested one example of a sub-goal might be \u2018I need to get more power\u2019. But more immediately, he fears for the everyday internet user, who soon will \u2018not be able to know what is true anymore\u2019 as the internet is flooded with fake content \u2013 stories, photos and, increasingly, videos. Online is where the current race for AI supremacy is being waged, the starting gun fired last year when OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, released ChatGPT-3 to the public. Its simple interface and stunning capabilities swept the globe, as students, teachers, businesses and everyday users alike found ways to capitalise on having their own personal assistant.

The launch wasn\u2019t quite as successful, with a factual error spotted during its demo wiping $100billion of the value of the company. In March, staff tried to stop its launch, believing it generated inaccurate and dangerous statements. Dr Hinton said that, until last year, Google had acted as a \u2018proper steward\u2019, but now fears the competition fuelled by big tech won\u2019t stop without global regulation. In a statement to the New York Times, Google\u2019s chief scientist Jeff Dean said: \u2018We remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We\u2019re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\u2019 For their work on neural networks, Dr Hinton and his team won the Turing Award \u2013 the \u2018Nobel Prize of computing\u2019. Alan Turing, after whom the honour is named, famously devised a test to determine whether or not machines could think. Dr Hinton has described AI tools becoming more intelligent than people as an \u2018existential risk\u2019. \u2018The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people \u2013 a few people believed that,\u2019 said Dr Hinton. \u2018But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. \u2018Obviously, I no longer think that.\u2019 MORE : Italy reverses ChatGPT ban over possible privacy violations MORE : Experts urge pause on making AI \u2018more powerful\u2019 citing \u2018risks to society\u2019",

            "text": "Termed the \u2018Early May Bank Holiday\u2019, this weekend\u2019s has been shifted out of its typical place in the calendar thanks to some big news next week, which will inevitably have the eyes of the world upon it. Place your bets I speak, of course, of the return of Monetary Policy Committee week(ish), as central banks scattered around the world convene to decide the direction of travel for their interest rates and general messaging. The Bank of Japan took the early kick off, with new governor Kazuo Ueda this morning unveiling a comprehensive review of the bank\u2019s policy and scrubbing a mainstay of its forward guidance of late. No longer does the bank expect \u201cshort- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels\u201d, marking the first hawkish (or perhaps just not so dovish) shift from the last major central bank to do so. Midweek, two of the largest players join the fray, with Jerome Powell and Christine Lagarde set to make statements from the Fed and ECB, respectively. While markets are factoring in hikes from both, there is divergence in both speed and future course beyond May\u2019s moves. Burgers and bitcoin According to the CME FedWatch Tool, we\u2019re probably in store for another 25bps hike from the US central bank, with an 87.7% probability of such an event. Nobody\u2019s bidding higher, according to the tool, with the remaining 12.3% predicting a static day. From there, the Bank of America wagers Powell is finished with hiking and will pause come the June meeting, while DWS anticipates at least one further hike beyond next week. When will it start cutting? Please, it\u2019s about the journey, not the destination. Turn to the ECB, however, and we have a different story. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much threat of a pause, particularly given executive board member Isabel Schnabel\u2019s interview with Politico, in which she highlighted the potential of 50 basis points. That comes in line with Bank of America\u2019s Ruben Segura-Cayuela, who argued, absent any \u201cbad surprises on lending\u201d, that chunky move was the most likely. However, dependent on ECB forecasts and eurozone inflation data, Lagarde may well join her US counterpart in 25bps come Thursday. I know, I know\u2026 \u2018Where\u2019s Andrew?\u2019 I hear you cry! Well, Mr Bailey will have the benefit of an extra week\u2019s data and sentiment before announcing the decision made by him and his eight MPC compatriots, with the UK\u2019s interest rate not set to shift (or not) until 11 May. Fear not, the UK has been far from quiet, particularly if we shift our view ever so slightly to companies. On Wednesday, the Treasury Select Committee met to try and understand what\u2019s going on with UK stock market listings at the moment. The answer came back as, essentially, it\u2019s our own fault. You can find more detail here. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. Just a day later and the Competition and Markets Authority flexed its muscles, blocking Microsoft\u2019s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard more than a year after the deal first hit the wires. Citing the potential to stifle competition and reduce innovation and choice for \u201cyears to come\u201d, the CMA has put a temporary end to the sale, although we\u2019ll see what comes of the appeal. While Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith was a little more diplomatic in his statement, noting the firm\u2019s disappointment over the rejection of a \u201cpragmatic path\u201d, a spokesperson for Activision Blizzard was\u2026 less so. \u201cThe report\u2019s conclusions are a disservice to UK citizens, who face increasingly dire economic prospects. We will reassess our growth plans for the UK. Global innovators large and small will take note that \u2013 despite all its rhetoric \u2013 the UK is clearly closed for business.\u201d Ouch. WWPOGD? Clearly not listening was Deutsche Bank, which this morning revealed a deal to buy Numis at a 72% premium to the stock\u2019s 27 April closing price. The \u00a3410m deal has been seen as a much-needed vote of confidence in the UK, while Numis shares soared on the news, up 67% since market open. With the long weekend much nearer the horizon than when I began this briefing, it might be best to simply wish you all a lovely three days away from work \u2013 if anyone is even still working right now to read such wishes. NB. I am aware the bank holiday has not been shifted in honour of MPCs, but I am considering a campaign to enact such a policy.

            "text": "Seoul: Samsung Electronics is banning employees in its mobile and appliances division from using generative AI services such as ChatGPT, the company said on Tuesday, after instances of \"misuse\" of the technology. Interest in artificial intelligence chatbots has soared since the Microsoft-backed ChatGPT debuted in November. ChatGPT caused a global sensation for generating essays, songs, exams and even news articles from brief prompts. Critics have fretted over how ChatGPT and its competitors collect and process data. Major financial firms, including Goldman Sachs, have banned or restricted employees' use of ChatGPT-like platforms in recent months. South Korea's Samsung Electronics, one of the world's largest makers of memory chips and smartphones, has now joined that list. The ban applies to staff in the mobile and appliances division, a Samsung representative told AFP. An internal memo obtained by AFP says Samsung is working to find ways to use generative AI services in a \"security safe environment for employees so that work efficiency and convenience can be enhanced\". \"... until these measures are prepared, we are banning the use of generative AI services for company-owned computers temporarily,\" it said. The memo from the Suwon-based firm also advises staff to refrain from uploading work-related information to such platforms when logging in on personal computers outside company premises. It says there have been \"instances of misuse\" of ChatGPT-like features by Samsung employees, without giving details. More than 60 percent of Samsung staff said in an internal survey there were security risks with using generative AI platforms with company devices, according to the memo.",

            "text": "Hinton, 75, said he quit to speak freely about the dangers of AI, and in part regrets his contribution to the field. He was brought on by Google a decade ago to help develop the company\u2019s AI technology. Hinton\u2019s research led the way for current systems like ChatGPT. He told the New York Times that until last year he believed Google had been a \u201cproper steward\u201d of the technology, but that changed once Microsoft started incorporating a chatbot into its Bing search engine, and the company began becoming concerned about the risk to its search business. Some of the dangers of AI chatbots were \u201cquite scary\u201d, he told the BBC , warning they could become more intelligent than humans and could be exploited by \u201cbad actors\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the kind of intelligence we\u2019re developing is very different from the intelligence we have. 7 \"So it\u2019s as if you had 10,000 people and whenever one person learned something, everybody automatically knew it. And that\u2019s how these chatbots can know so much more than any one person.\u201d Hinton\u2019s concern in the short term is something that has already become a reality \u2013 people will not be able to discern what is true any more with AI-generated photos, videos and text flooding the internet. The recent upgrades to image generators such as Midjourney mean people can now produce photo-realistic images \u2013 one such image of Pope Frances in a Balenciaga puffer coat went viral in March. Hinton is also concerned that AI will eventually replace jobs like paralegals, personal assistants and other \u201cdrudge work\u201d, and potentially more in the future. Google\u2019s chief scientist, Jeff Dean said in a statement that Google appreciated Hinton\u2019s contributions to the company over the past decade. \u201cI\u2019ve deeply enjoyed our many conversations over the years. I\u2019ll miss him, and I wish him well. As one of the first companies to publish AI Principles, we remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We\u2019re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.\u201d It came as IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg that up to 30% of the company\u2019s back-office roles could be replaced by AI and automation within five years. Krishna said hiring in areas such as human resources will be slowed or suspended, and could result in around 7,800 roles being replaced. IBM has a total global workforce of 260,000. Last month, the Guardian was able to bypass a voice authentication system used by Services Australia using an online AI voice synthesiser, throwing into question the viability of voice biometrics for authentication. Toby Walsh, the chief scientist at the University of New South Wales\u2019 AI Institute, said people should be questioning any online media they see now. \u201cWhen it comes to any digital data you see \u2013 audio or video \u2013 you have to entertain the idea that someone has spoofed it.\u201d - The Guardian",

Hinton says the confusion between reality vs. AI-generated content will make it so people will \u201cnot be able to know what is true anymore.\u201d Learning too fast Like the scientists and thought leaders who signed the open letter a few months ago, Hinton is concerned with the speed at which AI technology is advancing. Major tech companies such as Google and Microsoft compete for AI dominance, causing the race to accelerate. \u201cLook at how it was five years ago and how it is now,\u201d Hinton said. \u201cTake the difference and propagate it forward. That\u2019s scary.\u201d Getting smarter than humans Hinton is one of the people responsible for developing a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks. He once said, \u201cThe only way to get artificial intelligence to work is to do the computation in a way similar to the human brain.\u201d But now he\u2019s worried that AI might become more advanced than the human brain. \u201cThe idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people \u2014 a few people believed that,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cBut most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.\u201d Hinton, 75, is now devoting the rest of his life to making sure the technology he helped to create won\u2019t destroy civilization. Does he feel bad about what he helped usher into the world? \u201cI console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn\u2019t done it, somebody else would have,\u201d he said.",

            "text": "Redfall \u2013 another bad launch (pic: Microsoft) As if a critical drubbing wasn\u2019t bad enough Xbox console exclusive Redfall is also being criticised by fans \u2013 especially in terms of the PC version. There are now two things which are almost guaranteed for the launch of every major new video game: that physical copies will have leaked out at least a week early and that if there\u2019s a PC version it will be a buggy mess that barely works at launch. Redfall at least didn\u2019t suffer from the first problem, since Xbox gamers buy far fewer physical copies than PlayStation owners, but it definitely suffers from some sadly familiar performance issues and bugs. The situation seems to be very similar to Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which had some problems on consoles but is much worse on PC, to the point where it\u2019s almost unplayable. Perhaps because it only just came out, Metacritic is not currently displaying user reviews for the game, which is likely also a sign of its new policy to try and prevent trolls abusing the feature \u2013 even if in this case some amount of anger may be justified. Steam has no such restrictions though and the game is currently rated as \u2018Mostly Negative\u2019 in terms of its reviews. \u2018Ignoring the performance issues, this game is bad. The AI is pathetic, even on the highest difficulty. The controls are clunky. The graphics are average. The world is empty. I don\u2019t understand why these companies think they can start charging $70 for unfinished garbage. I couldn\u2019t even stomach an hour of this game,\u2019 says reviewer Sean. \u2018Another strong contender for worst PC port of the year. How did Arkane regress from Dishonored to this?\u2019, asks the appropriately named aByZMal. Karan76k cuts to the heart of the issue, with what they describe as a \u2018next gen gaming starter pack\u2019: Same or even worse graphics fidelity than old gen games! Abysmal optimisation that requires RTX 4090 minimum and still can\u2019t hit 60fps! A $70-$90 price tag for a mid and unfinished games! Apology statement after releasing games in a broken state! After months of patching, nothing improves! The latter two things haven\u2019t happened yet but it\u2019s probably only a matter of time, in what has become a sadly predictable state of affairs. What makes it all worse is that it\u2019s not just one publisher, or even just a small group, but virtually all of them, with everyone from Sony to EA having put out a broken PC game at launch this year and only gradually fixing it over time. mail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, follow us on Twitter, and sign-up to our newsletter.

            "text": "The pioneer of Artificial Intelligence, Geoffrey Hinton, has resigned from Google after working for more than a decade with the tech company. The New York Times reported that Hinton has joined a growing army of critics who say companies are racing toward danger with their aggressive campaign to create products based on generative artificial intelligence, the technology that powers popular chatbots like ChatGPT. According to Hinton, who is considered the AI godfather, he quit his position at Google \u201cso he can freely speak out about the risks of A.I. A part of him, he said, now regrets his life\u2019s work.\u201d He believes that as companies improve their A.I. systems, they also become increasingly dangerous. \u201cLook at how it was five years ago and how it is now,\u201d he said of A.I. technology. \u201cTake the difference and propagate it forward. That\u2019s scary.\u201d Industry insiders, according to NYT, are afraid that AI is releasing something dangerous, noting that generative AI can be a tool for misinformation. Concerns have grown that it could be a risk to getting jobs and according to tech experts, the biggest worry is that it could be a risk to humanity. \u201cIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,\u201d Dr. Hinton said. According to the 75-year-old British, \u201cUntil last year, Google acted as a proper steward for the technology, careful not to release something that might cause harm. But now that Microsoft has augmented its Bing search engine with a chatbot \u2014 challenging Google\u2019s core business \u2014 Google is racing to deploy the same kind of technology. The tech giants are locked in a competition that might be impossible to stop.\u201d He stated that his immediate concern is that the internet will be flooded with false photos, videos and text, and the average person will not be able to know what is true anymore. He also worries that AI will upset the job market as already, chatbots like ChatGPT are now used to complement human workers, \u201cbut they could replace paralegals, personal assistants, translators and others who handle rote tasks. \u2018It takes away the drudge work, it might take away more than that,\u201d he said. Geoffrey Hinton is an artificial intelligence pioneer. In 2012, Dr. Hinton and two of his graduate students at the University of Toronto created technology that became the intellectual foundation for the A.I. systems that the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies believe is a key to their future, NYT reported.",

            "title": "This company adopted AI. Here's what happened to its human workers.",
            "text": "Lately, it's felt like technological change has entered warp speed. Companies like OpenAI and Google have unveiled new Artificial Intelligence systems with incredible capabilities, making what once seemed like science fiction an everyday reality. It's an era that is posing big, existential questions for us all, about everything from literally the future of human existence to \u2014 more to the focus of Planet Money \u2014 the future of human work. \"Things are changing so fast,\" says Erik Brynjolfsson, a leading, technology-focused economist based at Stanford University. Back in 2017, Brynjolfsson published a paper in one of the top academic journals, Science, which outlined the kind of work that he believed AI was capable of doing. It was called \"What Can Machine Learning Do? Workforce Implications.\" Now, Brynjolfsson says, \"I have to update that paper dramatically given what's happened in the past year or two.\" Sure, the current pace of change can feel dizzying and kinda scary. But Brynjolfsson is not catastrophizing. In fact, quite the opposite. He's earned a reputation as a \"techno-optimist.\" And, recently at least, he has a real reason to be optimistic about what AI could mean for the economy. Last week, Brynjolfsson, together with MIT economists Danielle Li and Lindsey R. Raymond, released what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical study of the real-world economic effects of new AI systems. They looked at what happened to a company and its workers after it incorporated a version of ChatGPT, a popular interactive AI chatbot, into workflows. What the economists found offers potentially great news for the economy, at least in one dimension that is crucial to improving our living standards: AI caused a group of workers to become much more productive. Backed by AI, these workers were able to accomplish much more in less time, with greater customer satisfaction to boot. At the same time, however, the study also shines a spotlight on just how powerful AI is, how disruptive it might be, and suggests that this new, astonishing technology could have economic effects that change the shape of income inequality going forward. The Rise Of Cyborg Customer Service Reps The story of this study starts a few years ago, when an unnamed Fortune 500 company \u2014 Brynjolfsson and his colleagues have not gotten permission to disclose its identity \u2014 decided to adopt an earlier version of OpenAI's ChatGPT. This AI system is an example of what computer scientists call \"generative AI\" and also a \"Large Language Model,\" systems that have crunched a ton of data \u2014 especially text \u2014 and learned word patterns that enable them to do things like answer questions and write instructions. This company provides other companies with administrative software. Think like programs that help businesses do accounting and logistics. A big part of this company's job is helping its customers, mostly small businesses, with technical support. The company's customer support agents are based primarily in the Philippines, but also the United States and other countries. And they spend their days helping small businesses tackle various kinds of technical problems with their software. Think like, \"Why am I getting this error message?\" or like, \"Help! I can't log in!\" Instead of talking to their customers on the phone, these customer service agents mostly communicate with them through online chat windows. These troubleshooting sessions can be quite long. The average conversation between the agents and customers lasts about 40 minutes. Agents need to know the ins and outs of their company's software, how to solve problems, and how to deal with sometimes irate customers. It's a stressful job, and there's high turnover. In the broader customer service industry, up to 60 percent of reps quit each year. Facing such high turnover rates, this software company was spending a lot of time and money training new staffers. And so, in late 2020, it decided to begin using an AI system to help its constantly churning customer support staff get better at their jobs faster. The company's goal was to improve the performance of their workers, not replace them. Now, when the agents look at their computer screens, they don't only see a chat window with their customers. They also see another chat window with an AI chatbot, which is there to help them more effectively assist customers in real time. It advises them on what to potentially write to customers and also provides them with links to internal company information to help them more quickly find solutions to their customers' technical problems. This interactive chatbot was trained by reading through a ton of previous conversations between reps and customers. It has recognized word patterns in these conversations, identifying key phrases and common problems facing customers and how to solve them. Because the company tracks which conversations leave its customers satisfied, the AI chatbot also knows formulas that often lead to success. Think, like, interactions that customers give a 5 star rating. \"I'm so sorry you're frustrated with error message 504. All you have to do is restart your computer and then press CTRL-ALT-SHIFT. Have a blessed day!\" Equipped with this new AI system, the company's customer support representatives are now basically part human, part intelligent machine. Cyborg customer reps, if you will. Lucky for Brynjolfsson, his colleagues, and econ nerds like us at Planet Money, this software company gave the economists inside access to rigorously evaluate what happened when customer service agents were given assistance from intelligent machines. The economists examine the performance of over 5,000 agents, comparing the outcomes of old-school customer reps without AI against new, AI-enhanced cyborg customer reps. What Happened When This Company Adopts AI The economists' big finding: after the software company adopted AI, the average customer support representative became, on average, 14 percent more productive. They were able to resolve more customer issues per hour. That's huge. The company's workforce is now much faster and more effective. They're also, apparently, happier. Turnover has gone down, especially among new hires. Not only that, the company's customers are more satisfied. They give higher ratings to support staff. They also generally seem to be nicer in their conversations and are less likely to ask to speak to an agent's supervisor. So, yeah, AI seems to really help improve the work of the company's employees. But what's even more interesting is that not all employees gained equally from using AI. It turns out that the company's more experienced, highly skilled customer support agents saw little or no benefit from using it. It was mainly the less experienced, lower-skilled customer service reps who saw big gains in their job performance. \"And what this system did was it took people with just two months of experience and had them performing at the level of people with six months of experience,\" Brynjolfsson says. \"So it got them up the learning curve a lot faster \u2014 and that led to very positive benefits for the company.\" Brynjolfsson says these improvements make a lot of sense when you think about how the AI system works. The system has analyzed company records and learned from highly rated conversations between agents and customers. In effect, the AI chatbot is basically mimicking the company's top performers, who have experience on the job. And it's pushing newbies and low performers to act more like them. The machine has essentially figured out the recipe for the magic sauce that makes top performers so good at their jobs, and it's offering that recipe for the workers who are less good at their jobs. That's great news for the company and its customers, as well as the company's low performers, who are now better at their jobs. But, Brynjolfsson says, it also raises the question: should the company's top performers be getting paid even more? After all, they're now not only helping the customers they directly interact with. They're now also, indirectly, helping all the company's customers, by modeling what good interactions look like and providing vital source material for the AI. \"It used to be that high-skilled workers would come up with a good answer and that would only help them and their customer,\" Brynjolfsson says. \"Now that good answer gets amplified and used by people throughout the organization.\" The Big Picture While Brynjolfsson is cautious, noting that this is one company in one study, he also says one of his big takeaways is that AI could make our economy much more productive in the near future. And that's important. Productivity gains \u2014 doing more in less time \u2014 are a crucial component for rising living standards. After years of being disappointed by lackluster productivity growth, Brynjolfsson is excited by this possibility. Not only does AI seem to be delivering productivity gains, it seems to deliver them pretty fast. \"And the fact that we're getting some really significant benefits suggests that we could have some big benefits over the next few years or decades as these systems are more widely used,\" Brynjolfsson says. When machines take over more work and boost our productivity, Brynjolfsson says, that's generally a great thing. It means that society is getting richer, that the economic pie is getting larger. At the same time, Brynjolfsson says, there are no guarantees about how this pie will be distributed. Even when the pie gets bigger, there are people who could see their slice get smaller or even disappear. \"It's very clear that it's not automatic that the bigger pie is evenly shared by everybody,\" Brynjolfsson says. \"We have to put in place policies, whether it's in tax policy or the strategy of companies like this one, which make sure the gains are more widely shared.\" Higher productivity is a really important finding. But what's probably most fascinating about this study is that it adds to a growing body of evidence that suggests that AI could have a much different effect on the labor market than previous waves of technological change. For the last few decades, we've seen a pattern that economists have called \"skill-biased technological change.\" The basic idea is that so-called \"high-skill\" office workers have disproportionately benefited from the use of computers and the internet. Things like Microsoft Word and Excel, Google, and so on have made office workers and other high-paid professionals much better at their jobs. Meanwhile, however, so-called \"low-skill\" workers, who often work in the service industry, have not benefited as much from new technology. Even worse, this body of research finds, new technology killed many \"middle-skill\" jobs that once offered non-college-educated workers a shot at upward mobility and a comfortable living in the middle class. In this previous technological era, the jobs that were automated away were those that focused on doing repetitive, \"routine\" tasks. Tasks that you could provide a machine with explicit, step-by-step instructions how to do. It turned out that, even before AI, computer software was capable of doing a lot of secretarial work, data entry, bookkeeping, and other clerical tasks. And robots, meanwhile, were able to do many tasks in factories. This killed lots of middle class jobs. The MIT economist David Autor has long studied this phenomenon. He calls it \"job polarization\" and a \"hollowing out\" of the middle class. Basically, the data suggests that the last few decades of technological change was a major contributor to increasing inequality. Technology has mostly boosted the incomes of college-educated and skilled workers while doing little for \u2014 and perhaps even hurting \u2014 the incomes of non-college-educated and low-skilled workers. Upside Downside But, what's interesting is, as Brynjolfsson notes, this new wave of technological change looks like it could be pretty different. You can see it in his new study. Instead of experienced and skilled workers benefiting mostly from AI technology, it's the opposite. It's the less experienced and less skilled workers who benefit the most. In this customer support center, AI improved the know-how and intelligence of those who were new at the job and those who were lower performers. It suggests that AI could benefit those who were left behind in the previous technological era. \"And that might be helpful in terms of closing some of the inequality that previous technologies actually helped amplify,\" Brynjolfsson says. So one benefit of intelligence machines is \u2014 maybe \u2014 they will improve the know-how and smarts of low performers, thereby reducing inequality. But \u2014 and Brynjolfsson seemed a bit skeptical about this \u2014 it's also possible that AI could lower the premium on being experienced, smart, or knowledgeable. If anybody off the street can now come in and \u2014 augmented by a machine \u2014 start doing work at a higher level, maybe the specialized skills and intelligence of people who were previously in the upper echelon become less valuable. So, yeah, AI could reduce inequality by bringing the bottom up. But it could also reduce inequality by bringing the top and middle down, essentially de-skilling a whole range of occupations, making them easier for anyone to do and thus lowering their wage premium. Of course, it's also possible that AI could end up increasing inequality even more. For one, it could make the Big AI companies, which own these powerful new systems, wildly rich. It could also empower business owners to replace more and more workers with intelligent machines. And it could kill jobs for all but the best of the best in various industries, who keep their jobs because maybe they're superstars or because maybe they have seniority. Then, with AI, these workers could become much more productive, and so their industries might need fewer of these types of jobs than before. The effects of AI, of course, are still very much being studied \u2014 and these systems are evolving fast \u2014 so this is all just speculation. But it does look like AI may have different effects than previous technologies, especially because machines are now more capable of doing \"non-routine\" tasks. Previously, as stated, it was only \"routine\" tasks that proved to be automatable. But, now, with AI, you don't have to program machines with specific instructions. They are much more capable of figuring out things on the fly. And this machine intelligence could upend much of the previous thinking on which kinds of jobs will be affected by automation. Next week, in the Planet Money newsletter, we speak with MIT's David Autor, who pioneered much of the economic thinking about technological change, automation, inequality, and upward mobility in the past few decades. What's he thinking now? Stay tuned!",

            "title": "A faster Dall-E? How to use Bing Image Creator for blogs, presentations, or  just for fun",
            "text": "Before the ChatGPT revolution, most people encountered generative AI through image synthesis tools \u2013 namely Dall-E. While early implementations were slow and did not always return the output you had in mind, newer versions of Dall-E have improved remarkably and can often create images that look indistinguishable from reality. Having reached a level of refinement, the OpenAI product was integrated into the offerings of OpenAI\u2019s largest investor, Microsoft. Microsoft last month announced Image Creator, which does exactly what its name suggests with nothing but simple text prompts. So how can you use it and what are its top features? Let\u2019s find out. What is Bing Image Creator and how does it work? Bing Image Creator is a generative AI model powered by an advanced version of the Dall-E model, which can produce realistic and diverse images from natural language descriptions. You can use Bing Image Creator to create images for various purposes, such as newsletters, blogs, presentations, or just for fun. Thanks to copious amounts of training on billions of samples picked from all over the internet, tools like Image Creator can generate images that are so realistic-looking that you\u2019ll often find yourself squinting, trying to spot irregularities that can give the image away. Take the Pope in Balenciaga puffer jacket image that went viral fooling millions, for example. While that image was created by Midjourney v5 and that tool is on a whole another level, Bing Image Creator isn\u2019t far behind. You can squeeze high-quality images out of it too, provided that your prompts are detailed enough. Outputs can also be instructed to follow a particular art style \u2013 abstract, clipart, comics, photorealistic, you name it. Is Bing Image Creator free? Yes, unlike Dall-E 2 which offers a very limited amount of credits before you\u2019re forced to \u2018recharge,\u2019 Bing Image Creator is completely free to use. You are given 100 \u2018boosts\u2019 that replenish on a weekly basis, which have likely been put in place to limit server tiedown. When you have these boosts, image generation is much faster. After you run out, you can still see the results of your prompt, but the process is a lot slower. There is no real money payment involved to recharge your boosts, but you can still get some more by converting your Microsoft Rewards points. The option to recharge the boosts doesn\u2019t show up until you run out. How to use Bing Image Creator Bing Image Creator has no waitlist involved so you can get started with it immediately. The only thing you\u2019d need is a Microsoft account. Here\u2019s a step-by-step tutorial on how you can use the AI tool: 1. Launch the Bing Image Creator website and hit the Join & Create button. 2. You\u2019ll be asked to log in to your Microsoft account here. If you don\u2019t have one, simply sign up for a new account. 3. Next, enter a description of an image you\u2019d like to see and hit the Create button. 4. Wait while the AI creates your image. 5. Once the process is done, you will see four images reflecting your prompt. You can select one of them or ask for more options. 6. You can also modify the image by using different styles, such as realistic, sketch, or comic. 7. You can save or share the image by clicking on the three dots icon on the top right corner of the image. 8. Your previous creations can be found under the Creations tab. Do note that the largest size you can get from Bing is 1024x1024 pixels and that the aspect ratio will always be 1:1. You can also access Bing Image Creator from Bing Chat - just start your prompt with \u201cGenerate an image of\u201d followed by the description of your image. Bing Chat can alternatively be used via SwiftKey keyboard and Bing mobile apps. How to create better prompts Image Creator is different from searching for an image on Bing. Here, the more detailed you are, the better chances you have at getting the tool to generate an image you have in mind. Think of the tool as a human artist who needs precise instructions on what to draw for you. Prompt engineering is a skill in and of itself, so you might want to get creative, adding details, adjectives, locations, and artistic styles. If you need inspiration, try browsing the Explore ideas tab and taking a look at the prompts that created each image therein. Here\u2019s an example of what a detailed prompt looks like: instead of a text prompt for \"panda,\" try submitting a prompt for \"a panda bear basking in the sun chewing bamboo, digital art\".",

Hiring specifically in back-office functions such as human resources will be suspended or slowed, Krishna said, adding that 30% of non-customer-facing roles could be replaced by AI and automations in five years. His comment comes at a time when AI has caught the imagination of people around the world after the launch of Microsoft Corp-backed OpenAI's viral chatbot, ChatGPT, in November last year.

            "text": "Barron Trump is a well-known Family Member who was born on March 20, 2006, in New York Metropolis, New York. With an exceptional talent and skill set, Barron Trump has established a successful career over the years, earning widespread recognition and acclaim. Barron Trump\u2019s Net Worth As of 2023, Barron Trump net worth is estimated to be $ 80 million. This includes his father Donald Trump\u2019s assets that he might inherit in the future. Since he is a child, his net worth cannot be accurately estimated. Bio of Barron William Trump Barron William Trump, the youngest son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, was born on March 20, 2006. Though the fifth child of his father, he is the only one the former president shares with his wife Melania Trump. While on his father\u2019s side, he has German and American ancestry, Trump inherits Slovene heritage from his mother. Since coming into the spotlight with his father\u2019s assuming office as president, Trump has consistently maintained fewer public appearances. As most people photographed him alongside his parents. People saw him at his father\u2019s acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention. Also, in the inauguration ceremony in Washington in early 2017. However, in the initial days of his father becoming president, Trump continued to stay in New York. He moved to Washington and the White House only a few months later, after completing the school year. In New York, he made history by not enrolling at Sidwell Friends, the school attended by children of other U.S. presidents for the past 35 years, and chose St. Andrew\u2019s Episcopal School in Potomac, Maryland instead. Trump is reportedly a computer whiz. He is also a keen sportsperson, with an active interest in soccer. However, he has previously played on the under-12 teams at D.C. United and the Arlington Soccer Association\u2019s under-14 soccer teams. His love for soccer is the reason for his enrollment at the Oxbridge Academy in Florida. Which is known for its soccer program for students. He will graduate from the 2024 batch of the Academy and everyone is waiting with bated breath to see what he will do next \u2014 join his father\u2019s business empire or do something of his own. Barron Trump career After Sasha and Malia Obama, the former first daughters, rose to fame in 2016, he began garnering media attention. Barron is undoubtedly the most sought-after celebrity child of the present. Due to his uncanny likeness to Melania Trump, Barron\u2019s mother, she refers to him as \u201cLittle Donald.\u201d In April 2016, Barron got recognition as the legitimate heir to the presidency after being recognized as the \u201cfifth son\u201d of President-elect Trump. His 20 Barron Trump Education He attends St. Andrew\u2019s Episcopal School in Maryland. In Manhattan, Trump attends Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School. As a bilingual person, he speaks both English and Slovene, which is the native language of his mother and the language he uses to communicate with his grandparents in New York. Barron Trump Whitehouse Life Barron Trump moved into the White House after finishing his school year 2016-2017. Until then he lived with his mother at the Trump Tower, where media reported that he had a whole floor to himself. He joined St. Andrew\u2019s Episcopal School in Maryland.

Because of the ongoing pandemic, Barron has to attend his school online, staying in the safety of The White House. People often saw him travelling with his parents to Florida to spend Thanksgiving. They go on a holiday trip to Mar-a-Lago. He has an interest in sports and loves Football. Also, as per reports, he is not allowed to pursue it as a career, mostly because of his father. Sources Of Barron Trump\u2019s Wealth Barron Trump, the youngest son of former President Donald Trump. He has a net worth of around $9 million. Where did this money come from? One source is the Trump family business. According to Forbes, Barron\u2019s mother, Melania Trump, have a net worth of $50 million. Given the details of her prenuptial agreement with Donald Trump\u2014which states that any inheritance she receives from her late husband will be split between the couple\u2019s two children\u2014a share of that sum likely went to Barron. Endorsements and Deals Barron Trump also earns money through public appearances, endorsements, and deals with outside organisations. For example, he was recently featured in an advertisement for the Singapore-based Horace Apparel Company, for which he was compensated monetarily. In addition to his mother\u2019s inheritance, Barron may also be receiving dividends from investments he holds in his father\u2019s trust fund. These include stakes in companies such as Coca-Cola and Microsoft. While there are no exact figures, Barron\u2019s wealth is thought to be largely derived from these investments, given the size and diversity of his portfolio. Barron Trump\u2019s Girlfriend Barron is single as far as his personal life is concerned. His youth, however, prevents him from having ever been in a committed relationship.

            "title": "Google I/O 2023: What to expect from the Pixel Fold, Pixel 7a, AI, and more",
            "text": "Caught unprepared for the sudden rise of ChatGPT and conversational AI, the firm is likely to announce some innovations for its internet apps based on artificial intelligence. This is risky given Bard managed to knock $100 billion (\u00a380bn) off the stock price with a single mistake earlier this year. And then there\u2019s hardware, too. The Pixel range is likely to see three new additions unveiled, one of which will be Google\u2019s first entry into the foldable phone race. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting from Google I/O. All the big tech giants have annual developer conferences to showcase new technology and products. Apple has WWDC, Microsoft has Build, Meta has F8 and Google has I/O. It stands for Input/Output, if you\u2019re curious. A developer conference sounds like it will be of interest to only developers rather than consumers. While that\u2019s true of much of the content, the main keynote often contains some big software and hardware announcements. Google in previous years has used I/O to unveil big changes to Android and even some hardware. The Pixel 3a \u2014 Google\u2019s first cheap Pixel handset \u2014 was announced at I/O and last year we were treated to previews of the Pixel 7, Pixel Watch and still unreleased Pixel Tablet. So there\u2019s plenty there for consumers to get excited about. This year, Google I/O is scheduled for Wednesday, May 10. The event is at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, so will be eight hours behind us. In the past, that\u2019s translated to pretty reasonable times to watch from the UK, as the keynote tends to be first thing in the morning. This year, it\u2019s 10am PT, which is 6pm on this side of the Atlantic. Google broadcasts its keynote to everyone on its YouTube platform. On the day, just head to the official YouTube channel and click on the \u201cLive\u201d tab to watch as it happens. It looks extremely likely that we\u2019ll see at least three bits of hardware unveiled at Google I/O 2023. There may also be a surprise or two, given the Pixel Tablet was originally unveiled last year without any kind of leaks giving the game away early. That\u2019s not the case for the Pixel Fold, though, which has long been rumoured due to various clues hidden away in the Android operating system and other more conventional leaks. Most recently, the extremely reliable leaker Evan Blass has shared what looks like official marketing shots of the foldable. It appears to be a direct rival to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 \u2014 a regular phone which opens up to reveal an inner mini tablet. Specs-wise, it\u2019ll reportedly be similar to the Pixel 7, with the same Tensor G2 chip powering things, backed up by 12GB RAM and either 256 or 512GB of storage. It\u2019ll apparently have a triple camera array on the back: a 48MP main sensor, accompanied by two 10.8MP lenses \u2014 one telephoto and one ultrawide. Expect to pay a small fortune for Google\u2019s first foldable, though. It\u2019s rumoured to be coming in at $1,800 \u2014 or around \u00a31,440. After tax is added, that might be comparable to the \u00a31,649 the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 starts at. If you\u2019re looking for a quality handset that\u2019s considerably more affordable, the Pixel 7a is likely to be worth holding out for. The current Pixel 6a retails for \u00a3399, and it\u2019s likely its successor will be similarly competitive. Google\u2019s \u2018a\u2019 line of Pixel handsets generally make cuts to the phones in sensible areas while maintaining much of the appeal. Crucially, they include an unskinned Android operating system that\u2019s first in line for updates straight from Google. Leaked marketing literature shows that the Pixel 7a will use the same Tensor G2 chip as the Pixel 7 and feature a dual-camera array led by a 64MP main lens. For the first time in an A-series device, it\u2019s expected to support wireless charging. The Pixel Tablet was teased at last year\u2019s I/O with a launch window of this year. In the intervening months, it\u2019s popped up at various official Google events \u2014 including an exhibition at Milan Design Week. Although, bluntly, Android tablets aren\u2019t that interesting, the Pixel Tablet looks like an exception to the rule. It\u2019s set to launch with a dock that not only acts as a charger, but also has a built-in speaker, turning the tablet into a makeshift smart screen like Google\u2019s Nest Hub. If done right, a tablet and smarthome hub in one could be a seriously good product, and it\u2019s well worth keeping an eye on. While we\u2019ll likely be shown what\u2019s coming to Android 14 and Wear OS 4, the most interesting announcements are likely to come with what Google is doing with AI \u2014 and specifically how it plans to deal with the explosion in ChatGPT\u2019s usage in the past eight months. This is a controversial area, with an early Bard error triggering a $100 billion hit to the company value and \u2018godfather of AI\u2019 Dr. Geoffrey Hinton quitting Google so he can talk about the risks that artificial intelligence poses to humanity. Nonetheless, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has been quite clear that Google will keep working on AI, and we expect the latest innovations to feature prominently in the keynote. The latest version of Bard \u2014 Google\u2019s answer to ChatGPT \u2014 will no doubt make an appearance. We\u2019d also expect details of how the company plans to integrate generative AI features in Google Workspace web apps such as Docs, Gmail, Slides and Meet. With Microsoft integrating ChatGPT into Bing, we\u2019d also expect details of how the company plans to integrate AI into Google search \u2014 by far the most profitable part of the business.",

            "title": "Why are Google's consultants advising on EU monopoly policy?",
            "text": "Now the commission has outsourced developing its merger policy to none other than a consultancy that helps Google push through mergers and acquisitions. It seems the European Commission hasn't learned from its past scandals so it's high time for MEPs to act to stop this problem. In 2021 the European Commission hired the economic consultancy firm RBB Economics to evaluate one of its merger control tools. RBB Economics isn't a household name, but its role in merger controls cannot be underestimated. The company works for some of the largest corporations in the world to push through mergers and acquisitions and has a long-standing relationship with Google and several other tech companies. It has played a role as a consultant for big companies in most of the recent big and controversial merger cases handled by EU competition authorities. Moreover, RBB Economics has for years lobbied in favour of weak enforcement of the EU's merger rules, and against key provisions of the Digital Markets Act which aims to rein in Big Tech's monopoly power. In May 2021 a partner at RBB economics said in a panel discussion organised with Apple that in \"[digital] markets concentration is natural\" and that tech monopolies should be rewarded for their 'risky investments' with \"monopoly rents\". Almost no EU mergers blocked The European Commission's evaluation of its merger rules comes at a crucial moment. Decades of lax merger enforcement policies have led to ever more market concentration. Studies have shown that extreme market concentration leads to increased income inequality, weakened labour rights, higher prices for consumers, and undermines democracy. In no other sector is this more obvious than tech. Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon are four of the top five largest companies in the world by market capitalisation. Big Tech has used its dominance to acquire any potential competitors that might threaten this status. Meanwhile regulators have barely intervened to block any of its mergers. European Commission figures show that between 1990 and 2021 only 30 out of 8083 notified mergers were blocked by the EU, a mere 0.37 per cent. A study for Corporate Europe Observatory shows that the commission approved nine out of 10 notified mergers without any conditions. However, with the recently approved Digital Markets Act (DMA) Big Tech market power has come under increased public and regulatory scrutiny in Europe. Additionally, in 2021 the Commission started a broad review of its competition policy, in part to tackle the harm caused by digital monopolies. In a context where market concentration and monopoly power are finally being questioned by regulators, it is especially alarming that an important part of that agenda is being outsourced to a consultancy company with a long track record of defending companies with monopoly interests. Normalising conflicts of interest The European Commission has previous form in hiring consultancy firms to undertake investigations and analysis in a policy area where these consultancies have a financial interest. In 2020 this caused a major scandal when the commission decided to hire the asset manager BlackRock \u2014 perhaps the world's premium fossil fuel investor \u2014 to investigate how to make banking more sustainable. More than 30 MEPs signed a protest letter, and some joined a coalition of NGOs who complained to the European Ombudsman. The ombudsman's resulting decision was remarkably robust, calling for an overhaul of the rules. While the commission did follow up by drafting several amendments to the Financial Regulation, our research shows that it has not made any attempt to strengthen its own internal procedures on hiring consultants with conflicts of interest. This explains how RBB Economics could be handed a contract that allows them to gain another foothold in EU competition policy. To have any credibility going forward the commission must end its tradition of hiring consultants with a strong vested interest, and chart a different path in its approach to mergers. And MEPs should demand that the Commission introduces a genuine check on conflicts of interest before awarding contracts on politically important consultancy work. Most significantly, the European Parliament is negotiating a reform of the Financial Regulation which offers a unique opportunity to ensure that consultancy firms with a vested interest are once and for all excluded from public tenders. Let's not squander this moment.",

            "title": "TechScape: Why Microsoft\u2019s mega-merger with Activision Blizzard is stalling",
            "text": "\u201cOh my god. Wow.\u201d Phone calls with law professors about regulatory actions don\u2019t normally start with unprompted expressions of amazement, but regulatory actions don\u2019t normally come like this. Anne Witt, professor of law and member of the EDHEC Augmented Law Institute, had been expecting to have a very different conversation when we spoke last Wednesday. But then, just minutes before we were due to talk, the UK\u2019s competition regulator blocked Microsoft\u2019s attempted $68.7bn acquisition of megadeveloper Activision Blizzard, the sprawling corporation behind games including Candy Crush Saga, World of Warcraft, Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater and, most importantly, Call of Duty. Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is just one of a number of international regulators which was investigating the proposed acquisition. In the US, the Federal Trade Commision (FTC) had already sued to block the takeover in December, with the case due in court later this year. The European Union is investigating, and has given itself a deadline of 22 May to make a decision, while Australia has paused its own investigation while it engages with overseas regulators. One of those regulators had already given the deal a pass. In March, the Japan Fair Trade Commission ruled that it was \u201cunlikely to result in substantially restraining competition\u201d, and approved it to go ahead. Japan\u2019s justification for allowing the merger was also behind Witt\u2019s expectation it would be approved. \u201cFor 30 years or so, competition agencies, very much influenced by the US school, have taken the view that \u2018vertical mergers\u2019 are rarely dangerous,\u201d she explained, once the shock had worn off. \u201cIf you have a \u2018horizontal merger\u2019 \u2013 if Microsoft had bought up a competitor \u2013 it is very evident that that will have a direct effect on competition, because it eliminates one player in the market. But if you buy an input, competition is not immediately reduced. So there needs to be an additional action \u2013 they need to use the input in order to foreclose competition by denying competitors access to that input. And normally this is only problematic if there is no alternative. \u201cThe second issue is that by denying competitors access to the input, Microsoft forgoes a profit, so their key argument is \u2018this is not at all profitable for us\u2019.\u201d Wheat and chaff This doctrine is clearer in a more physical, fungible market. If you turn wheat into bread and you buy a wheat supplier \u2013 well, all your baker competitors will just buy their wheat from someone else if you try and stop them getting wheat from your new subsidiary. And even if they can\u2019t, it\u2019s still probably not worth your while to block them, because the amount you have to pay for the acquisition means you\u2019re buying all those future revenue streams: stopping the sales would be a very expensive way to cut your nose off to spite your face. Even before the acquisition was referred to competition regulators, it was clear this doctrine would drive the discussion. Then, early this year, the CMA gave ground on what seemed like the key question: whether Microsoft\u2019s purchase did risk damaging competition in console gaming. Critics of the deal had argued that it was different from the textbooks because of the singular power of Activision Blizzard\u2019s Call of Duty series. Those military shooters are the sort of game, along with EA\u2019s erstwhile Fifa series, that millions of people play almost to the exclusion of all others. That means it\u2019s not easy for a competitor to Microsoft to simply substitute another game: \u201cJust make your own Call of Duty\u201d is the video-game equivalent of Richard Branson deciding to compete with Coca Cola in the 90s, and likely to be about as successful. But Microsoft offered binding promises that it wouldn\u2019t withhold the game series from competitors, and the CMA accepted that those, plus the financial loss it would take from foregoing millions of sales on other platforms, were sufficient to conclude that the contest between Microsoft\u2019s Xbox and Sony\u2019s market-leading PlayStation wouldn\u2019t be unduly warped of the sale went ahead. And then, on Wednesday, the bombshell dropped: the acquisition would be blocked anyway. Although the CMA had publicly announced it wasn\u2019t concerned about the console market, it had concerns about another, much smaller industry: \u201ccloud gaming\u201d. The nascent sector is best known for its biggest failure, Google\u2019s Stadia product, which launched to much fanfare and was ingloriously shuttered earlier this year after failing to win market share. But the CMA argued that there\u2019s no innate reason for scepticism around cloud gaming: yes, each major attempt so far has dropped the ball somewhere, be that in the underlying technology, the product on offer, or the marketing pitch, but all it takes is for one to get it all right, and the next big gaming revolution could occur. And Microsoft, as it will happily admit, is the closest to getting it all right. The company already has a successful subscription product with hundreds of games, the technological chops and infrastructure to get the back-end working and an efficient marketing machine cranking into operation. That changes the calculations around a vertical merger, though. With no meaningful competitors, it\u2019s hard for Microsoft to promise it won\u2019t withhold Call of Duty, because it\u2019s hard to even know what the competitive landscape will look like. And the argument that it wouldn\u2019t forgo profit is harder to make when the potential profit from destroying a nascent competitor far outweighs the minimal profit to be gained from licensing fees in a small industry. So the CMA blocked the merger. And Microsoft and Activision kicked off. What next? The two companies have spent the last week doing a tour of the airwaves, arguing that the decision to block the merger proves that the UK isn\u2019t ready for a vibrant tech sector. Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, hit the government where it hurts, saying that post-Brexit Britain had a worse regulatory state than the EU did, while Activision\u2019s fighty head of comms, Lulu Cheng Meservey, said that the company would \u201creassess our growth plans for the UK\u201d. In the narrow view, such arguments are unlikely to win decision-makers round. For all that Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives profess to love tech startups, their record in government record is more focused at the other end of the industry, with perennial promises to take on \u201cbig tech\u201d on areas ranging from online moderation through to competition policy itself. A trillion-dollar company being prevented from buying a $70bn one falls squarely in that battle, and there will be some inside government who view Microsoft\u2019s ultimately toothless complaints as a sign of victory. But the bigger question is how broadly the CMA\u2019s new doctrine is applied. Taken at face value, the regulator is effectively arguing that any acquisition in a nascent sector could be blocked on competition grounds. That could chill investment in a host of promising areas, critics argue: everyone would like to start the business that topples Facebook, but it\u2019s not worth the financial risk to backers unless there\u2019s also the possibility of a payout for the near-miss of \u201conly\u201d being bought by Facebook. In practice, however, the details of the CMA\u2019s finding suggest it thinks it\u2019s mostly applicable to this sort of mega-scale vertical merger, rather than the more common acquisition of a much smaller company aimed at bringing new expertise and talent in to a conglomerate. Activision Blizzard isn\u2019t valuable to Microsoft purely because it could be useful in cloud gaming, but because its product is already so valuable in established console markets that it is table stakes for any company wanting to compete in new ones.

            "title": "Bill Gates Is &#039;Always Right&#039;: 3 Lessons From Ex-Microsoft VP | Entrepreneur - WorldNewsEra",
            "text": "From my very first meeting with Bill Gates it was clear he was someone you could learn from. That grilling in a tiny Microsoft conference room in the summer of 1992 was one I\u2019ll never forget. From then through to my time as Vice President of HR when I was afforded many one-on-one meetings with him, I learned many things from Bill Gates. Here are the 3 that stick with me. 1. Dig for answers Chris Williams via Business Insider That first meeting was just days after the Fox Software team arrived on the Microsoft campus in Redmond. Microsoft had paid over $170 million for the company, and it was clear Bill wanted to see what he\u2019d bought. Six of us, two of our top developers and me as the development manager, joined the owner and two program managers for our introduction to Bill. We were totally unaware how extraordinary a small face-to-face with him was. Pleasantries were rushed through quickly and it soon became clear the reason for the meeting. Our product, FoxPro, was many, many times faster than Cirrus, the Microsoft product it competed with (later released as Access). Bill wanted to understand why. He quickly figured out the developer responsible was Eric Christensen, a pure genius. Bill focused immediately on Eric and what followed resembled a Star Trek mind meld. Bill shot in rapid fire more and more detailed questions, until they were discussing the movement of single bits and the size of the Intel 80386 instruction cache. As quickly as it began, the meeting ended. Bill nodded and smiled, almost proud of himself. He\u2019d gotten his money\u2019s worth. We were free to go. In the years that passed, I saw Bill do this same kind of exercise time and again. He was always curious, always wanted to understand, always drilling for more detail. As a younger man this drilling was aggressive and harsh. As he got older, his passion for detail never left, just his method for getting there mellowed. Bill and I are only six months apart in age and during the time I worked with him I watched both of us grow. Maybe it was having children, maybe it was working with ever larger organizations, maybe it was just getting wiser with age. But both of us learned how to get to the details without making a mess in the process. 2. Smell the bull A big part of the reason for the drilling went far beyond fascination with the details. It was much more than just checking that the work was done. It was to identify the people who slung the bull. The people who, when cornered, just make things up. It seems that Bill learned early on that pressing for details until failure resulted in two kinds of responses. There were the people who were strong enough to admit, in the face of the then-richest man on the planet, that \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And there were those who just started making things up. Guessing at answers. Pulling things out of thin air. Bill wielded that cudgel with dexterity. His response to obvious bull was almost always \u201cthat\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d If it was egregiously wrong, he would throw in a personal insult or two. Questioning of one\u2019s parentage or education. The latter faded with time as he received feedback about how little the personal invective helped. But Bill\u2019s ability to smell the odor of falsehood only seemed to improve with age. Later you could tell you were in trouble just from his facial expressions. That look of disappointment that told you, oops, perhaps I should retreat here. It was hard to be in those rooms many times and not pick up some of that skill. I began to see the same kinds of signs. I learned to watch for the flittering eyes, the unsure tone, or the smell of desperation. In time I could recognize the face of someone who, it seemed, would rather die than say, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll find out and get back to you.\u201d 3. Synthesize from nothing Bill\u2019s greatest skill, however, was his ability to see a mess and find the structure. To face a deeply complex set of facts and opinions and determine precisely the meaning in the stew. To synthesize clarity from a whole lot of nothing. Too many times to count, I was in a project update with Bill and watched this skill at work. Teams would meet at least twice with him. Once for the project kickoff to ensure things were headed in a good direction, one that made sense and aligned with the rest of the company. Then they would meet shortly before release to confirm that the objectives were met, mostly just a Bill stamp of approval. The largest or most important projects were subjected to interim reviews \u2014 as many as two or three as the project progressed. It was at the start or during these interim reviews when this synthesis often happened. A team would bring in a deeply complex set of issues. Perhaps a fractured product market with a lot of competition and a broad range of possible technical opportunities to address the market. They would have miles of data and dozens of opinions on the correct path. They would say \u201cwe\u2019re struggling to decide if we should do X and build this, or head toward Y and build that.\u201d Within seconds Bill had absorbed it all. Somehow, someway, he found the two or three variables that really mattered. He would blurt out \u201cDon\u2019t you see, this and that are what matters, it\u2019s clear you should do X!\u201d The whole room would be silent, and then realize how right he was. Agreement was widely reached, a path was charted, the meeting soon adjourned. When I first saw this happen, I was sure it was simply people agreeing with the boss. I later realized the Microsoft culture wouldn\u2019t let that happen. If he was wrong, one of the senior people in the room would call him out. Someone who had earned his respect would\u2019ve shot back \u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d And laughed. No, he was virtually always right. He had found the two or five things that really mattered. The variables that changed the equation. And from there, the choice was obvious. Some of this was because he sat at the top of a large organization that itself was at the top of a large market. He had contacts, perspective, and visibility that many of us did not. But most of it was because of him. His skill at seeing both the details and the whole picture in one frame. His genius at figuring out what mattered, and more importantly what didn\u2019t. I\u2019ll admit I never learned how to do this. At least not at his level. I just learned to admire it. And I was fortunate enough to be able to get one-on-one time with him to use it. Use it for myself and the various teams I led at Microsoft. I learned a lot from spending time with Bill Gates. All the noise around his personal life that may have surfaced recently have done little to dampen that. When I think of how much the opportunity to be in the room with him taught me, I just smile.

            "title": "South China Sea military drills conceal secret war over global information highways",
            "text": "With the US and Philippines holding the largest-ever military drills in the South China Sea, followed by China and Singapore holding their own, tensions are heating up as the Phillippines reported a \u201cconfrontation\u201d between two of its vessels and the Chinese navy. As one of the world\u2019s most important shipping lanes for oil, minerals and food, whoever dominates the South China Sea will control over a fifth of global trade. But the biggest economic asset up for grabs in the region is Big Data \u2014 and the future of the entire internet depends on who wins the battle to dominate this strategic waterway. Control over the global internet at stake More than 486 undersea cables carry over 99% of all international internet traffic globally, according to the Washington-based research firm TeleGeography. The bulk of them are controlled by a handful of US technology giants, namely Google's parent company Alphabet, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft. Southeast Asia\u2019s internet economy is expected to reach $1 trillion (\u20ac913.1 billion) in value by 2030. Whoever controls the Asia-Pacific\u2019s subsea cabling infrastructure will not only dominate this booming economy but control the global internet. Internet data flows, carrying everything from emails and banking transactions to military secrets, are more valuable than oil. As such, the world\u2019s subsea cabling infrastructure is increasingly vulnerable not only to sabotage but also to espionage \u2014 spy agencies can easily tap into cables on their own territory. That\u2019s why the geopolitical rivalry between the US and China has increasingly focused on controlling the world\u2019s subsea cabling networks. This is the new Great Game China, which claims almost the entire South China Sea, is planning a $500 million undersea internet cable network to create a superfast connection linking up Asia with the Middle East and Europe. It is also impeding US-backed internet cable projects through the South China Sea by delaying licensing approvals and creating stricter operating restrictions. Meanwhile, the US government has thwarted several Chinese subsea cabling projects over concerns about Beijing\u2019s surveillance capabilities. At least six private undersea cable deals led by Google, Facebook and Amazon connecting the US with Hong Kong were blocked by Washington to keep HMN Tech \u2014 a subsidiary of the sanctioned Chinese firm Huawei \u2014 at bay. HMN Tech has won praise from the Chinese government as a model of \u201ccivil-military integration,\u201d and acknowledges that its activities \u201coffer powerful support for the modernisation of our country\u2019s national defence.\u201d New Western cable routes leave out Malaysia To bypass Chinese control, US tech giants Facebook and Google are building Apricot, the first intra-Asian subsea cable avoiding Hong Kong. The 12,000km cable will connect Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore \u2014 but excludes Malaysia, which has fast become the linchpin of US and Chinese competition to dominate the global internet. Malaysia\u2019s involvement in Apricot was scuppered due to a 2020 \"sabotage\" ban on foreign vessels in the autonomous Sabah region of eastern Malaysia to protect the local shipping industry from foreign competition. In response, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon wrote to the Malaysian government complaining that the ban would obstruct the new cable venture and requesting an urgent meeting with the prime minister. The request was ignored. As a result, Malaysia has been excluded not only from the Apricot route but also from the Echo and Bifrost cable routes across the South China Sea, also backed by Facebook and Google. Sultanate of Sulu claims are at the epicentre, again Local frustration over Malaysia\u2019s \u2018cabotage\u2019 ban has revived demands in Sabah for greater autonomy from the federal government. This dovetails with an international legal case on behalf of heirs of a colonial-era Sultanate in the remote Sulu archipelago of the Philippines. The Sultanate purportedly leased the region of Sabah to British colonists in 1878 in return for an annual payment which the petitioners have used to justify undermining Malaysian sovereignty in Sabah, claiming a percentage of oil and gas profits there. The lawyers representing the Sulu heirs have deep ties with the same US tech giants competing to dominate subsea internet cables in the South China Sea. Paul Cohen, a former speechwriter on the Clinton/Gore US presidential campaign, currently serves as President of the Silicon Valley Arbitration and Mediation Center, where he works in \u201cdialogue\u201d with these US tech firms. Cohen\u2019s colleague, Elisabeth Mason, is a board member of the US charity All-Star Code alongside three senior Google executives. She also founded the Stanford Poverty and Technology Lab with support from both the Obama-era White House and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Malaysia inching closer to China could affect the West's digital future This close proximity of the Sulu heirs\u2019 lawyers to US tech giants that bypassed Malaysia to pursue US-backed subsea internet cable routes will exacerbate Malaysian perceptions of Western hostility to its national interests. Indeed, Malaysia\u2019s exclusion from the US-backed subsea cabling projects has already accelerated the country\u2019s alliance with China. In 2022, Malaysia joined the 5,000-kilometre China-backed South East Asia Hainan Hong Kong Express Cable System (SEA-H2X), linking Hong Kong, China, the Philippines, and Thailand to eastern Malaysia and Singapore. The future of the global internet is at stake. If Malaysia falls under Chinese dominance, it will have major repercussions across the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), potentially triggering a domino effect. Yet the US and the West have a fresh opportunity for rapprochement under Malaysia\u2019s new government led by long-time democracy activist Anwar Ibrahim. Given the latter\u2019s first global trip to China, securing $38bn (\u20ac34.7bn) of investments, the West should act fast to ensure Malaysia recognises the benefits of digital cooperation with it.

            "text": "Geoffrey Hinton, a man often referred to as \u201cthe godfather of artificial intelligence\u201d, has quit his job at Google over concerns about the risks the technology poses to humanity. The computer scientist, who led the team that built an image analysis neural network in 2012, was employed by Google over the past decade to help develop the company\u2019s AI technology. This week, however, \u201che officially joined a growing chorus of critics who say [tech] companies are racing toward danger with their aggressive campaign to create products based on generative artificial intelligence, the technology that powers popular chatbots like ChatGPT\u201d, said The New York Times (NYT). Who is Geoffrey Hinton? The great-grandson of George Boole, the mathematician who invented Boolean algebra, Geoffrey Hinton was born in Wimbledon in 1947. Hinton said he was first inspired to pursue psychology and computer science after a school friend suggested that the brain might work like a hologram. To create holographic images, people record how beams of light bounce off an object. Applying this idea to the human mind, Hinton began to consider whether brains might work similarly, with each memory being spread out across a neural network rather than just in one location. \u201cI got very excited about that idea,\u201d he told Wired magazine in 2014. \u201cThat was the first time I got really into how the brain might work.\u201d The revelation led Hinton to explore neural networks at Cambridge and the University of Edinburgh. Eventually his work led him to try to develop a new way of using computing technology to create a form of AI that we now call \u201cdeep learning\u201d. This was once \u201can outlier\u201d, Wired said, but eventually deep learning became mainstream. Ultimately, according to The Guardian, Hinton\u2019s research \u201cled the way for current systems like ChatGPT\u201d. \u2018Bad actors will use it for bad things\u2019 In his interview with the NYT, Hinton said he has now quit Google specifically so he can speak freely out about the dangers posed by AI. \u201cIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,\u201d Hinton told the newspaper. According to Hinton, Google was a \u201cproper steward\u201d of AI technology until last year, when Microsoft started incorporating a chatbot into its Bing search engine. This made Google worried about its search business.",

            "text": "A ship owned by the US Navy which tipped over in a Scottish dry dock in March is floating again after being righted. It is thought the Edinburgh dock had to be flooded on Sunday to allow the MV Petrel to stand upright. The 3,371-tonne vessel was manoeuvred by two tugs around Imperial Dock in Leith on Tuesday. On March 22, it had toppled over, leaving dozens of crew injured. It prompted a massive emergency response to save those aboard as the ship was seen leaning at a 45-degree angle. Some 23 people were treated in hospital and 12 at the scene of the incident, NHS Lothian said. The ship had been moored at the Edinburgh dockyard since September 2020 following \u201coperational challenges\u201d from the Covid pandemic. In 2022, the Petrel was bought by the US Navy, and is currently operated by American-owned Oceaneering International. It was previously owned by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who used it to search for historically significant shipwrecks. An investigation into how it became dislodged has been lodged by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). A spokesperson said: \u201cA HSE team is continuing to work with Police Scotland on the ongoing investigation of this incident.\u201d",

            "text": "Sam Sabin Iran\u2019s state-backed hackers are expanding their cyber playbook to include disinformation campaigns, Microsoft warned in a report Tuesday. Driving the news: Microsoft estimates that the Iranian government was behind 24 \u201ccyber-enabled influence operations\u201d throughout 2022, including 17 since mid-June. That was more than three times as many as in 2021, when that number stood at seven. Why it matters: Microsoft\u2019s findings mark an escalation in Iran\u2019s adversarial cyber interests, given the country has historically leaned solely on more-traditional disruptive hacks in its operations. Typically, Russia and China have been the only two U.S. adversaries that lean on disinformation in their schemes. Threat level: While Iran\u2019s tactics are changing, the government\u2019s targets remain largely the same, Microsoft said. The disinformation operations have largely focused on Israel, prominent Iranian opposition figures and Tehran\u2019s Gulf state adversaries. Between October and March, Iran directed nearly a quarter of its cyber operations against Israel \u2014 although the U.S., the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia also bore \u201cthe brunt of these efforts,\u201d per the report. Most of these cyber-enabled influence operations are run by an Iranian group that Microsoft tracks as Cotton Sandstorm. Others call the group Emennet Pasargad. Details: Iran currently has a \u201cpredictable playbook\u201d in its influence operations, Microsoft said. First, Iranian state-backed hackers use online accounts they\u2019ve already established \u2014 including those on social media and messaging services \u2014 to \u201cpublicize and exaggerate\u201d the impact of a low-level cyberattack. Some of the posts are published on social media, while others are sent to specific targets via text message. Then, a flurry of inauthentic online personas will rush to amplify and \u201coften further hype\u201d the impact of the attacks, the company noted. The intrigue: Microsoft has detected a \u201ccorresponding\u201d decline in the number of Iran-backed ransomware and wiper attacks as the government\u2019s teams shift to disinformation. However, Microsoft warned that the threat of future cyberattacks on U.S. and Israeli critical infrastructure remains, as some Iranian groups are likely to be seeking new tactics for launching such attacks.

            "text": "South Korean tech conglomerate Samsung confirmed this week that it has banned the use of artificial intelligence technology, such as ChatGPT, on its professional devices. The company informed employees about the temporary restriction in a memo late last month. Apparently, the company became aware of employee misuse of the technology and moved quickly to ban it. According to reports, some employees uploaded sensitive Samsung data to the chatbot in an effort to fix problematic aspects of the source code. Large companies like Samsung are worried that uploading company data to the software could lead to security breaches, especially since ChatGPT is a foreign-owned technology. The company warned employees against using the chatbot outside of work and inputting personal information. According to an internal Samsung survey, 65% of respondents were concerned about safety risks when using generative AI. The ban comes during a tumultuous moment for AI technology. Microsoft\u2019s ChatGPT has exploded in popularity this year and has drawn proportional criticism. Other giant tech companies outside of Samsung, like Amazon and JPMorgan, have warned their employees about the consequences of sharing proprietary information like code with the chatbot. Several tech executives, including Elon Musk, have called for a six-month pause on AI development. Despite the perceived risk of AI, many companies still hope to integrate it into their overall business. Chatbot technology can be used to help employees organize data and get quick and easy answers to complicated questions. Companies have been using AI technology to develop new code and programs to speed up larger projects. While Samsung categorized the ban as temporary, it remains unclear when the ban will be lifted.",

            "text": "Inflection AI, the AI startup founded by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Deepmind researcher Mustafa Suleyman, has released its first AI chatbot product, the company said on Tuesday. Similar to the viral chatbot ChatGPT, Inflection's AI chatbot, named Pi, uses generative AI technology to interact with users through conversations, in which people can ask questions and share interests. Inflection AI said it developed the technology in-house and its Pi chatbot is built on prioritizing human conversations with a high level of emotional intelligence. \"We think of Pi as a digital companion on hand whenever you want to learn something new, when you need a sounding board to talk through a tricky moment in your day, or just pass the time with a curious and kind counterpart,\" said Mustafa Suleyman, chief executive and co-founder of Inflection. Users can interact with Pi across platforms including its website, app and social media platforms like Instagram. Pi uses user data, including conversational content, to train its AI systems, according to its terms of service. Inflection said its database was last updated in November 2022 and not currently connected to the internet. Chatbot powered by generative AI technology has become a crowded field since OpenAI's ChatGPT burst into the scene last November. Using large language models, which mine vast amounts of text to summarize information and generate content, chatbots like Google's Bard, and Character.AI enable people to have in-depth conversations for both professional and personal needs. VC firm Greylock, where Hoffman is a partner, incubated Inflection and led a $250 million investment in the firm. Hoffman, who is also sitting on the board of Microsoft, resigned from the board of OpenAI in March, citing potential conflicts with the AI startups he works with.",

The second day of bank stock declines comes after regulators closed First Republic Bank on Monday and sold the vast majority of its operations to JPMorgan Chase in a fire sale.

While discussing the deal to buy First Republic, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday that he believed \u201cthis part of this (banking) crisis is over.\" But the resolution of First Republic's ordeal didn't resolve all the problems at other banks. The ongoing concern among investors and regulators is that banks such as PacWest have large amounts of uninsured deposits \u2014 those above $250,000 \u2014 which have become a larger liability because rich and wealthy clients have shown themselves willing to pull their money out at the first sign of trouble. The banks are also exposed to low-interest loans that are now worth less on the open market due to the fact they were underwritten when interest rates were substantially lower. When Western Alliance reported its results last week, the bank noted that it had to start selling off some of its commercial and industrial loans in order to restore the health of its balance sheet, with the bank taking a loss on most of those loans. PacWest reported a loss in the first quarter because it had to write down some of the loans it planned to sell to clean up its own balance sheet.

Companies are needing less office space, and larger employers like Facebook parent company Meta, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and banks have been laying off employees, which should impact the demand for office space as well. Roughly a third of PacWest's balance sheet is tied up in construction and commercial real estate loans, while more than half of Western Alliance's balance sheet is commercial real estate, industrial loans and construction.

            "text": "Sounding alarms about artificial intelligence has become a popular pastime in the ChatGPT era, taken up by high-profile figures as varied as industrialist Elon Musk, leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky and the 99-year-old retired statesman Henry Kissinger. But it\u2019s the concerns of insiders in the AI research community that are attracting particular attention. A pioneering researcher and the so-called \u201cGodfather of AI\u201d Geoffrey Hinton quit his role at Google so he could more freely speak about the dangers of the technology he helped create. Over his decades-long career, Hinton\u2019s pioneering work on deep learning and neural networks helped lay the foundation for much of the AI technology we see today. There has been a spasm of AI introductions in recent months. San Francisco-based startup OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed company behind ChatGPT, rolled out its latest artificial intelligence model, GPT-4, in March. Other tech giants have invested in competing tools \u2014 including Google\u2019s \u201cBard.\u201d",
