            "title": "Sport, TV, tech and fashion: what does 2023 have in store for us?",
            "text": "Sport by Sean Ingle There has been an audible buzz about Jack Draper in tennis circles for a while. But in 2023 expect the 21-year-old from Sutton in south-west London, who also has a contract with IMG Models, to crash into the mainstream. He certainly has enough of the right stuff, including the whiplash serve and punishing groundstrokes on the court, and the looks and personality off it. Draper first advertised his talents by taking a set off Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon in 2021, but it was in 2022 that he really made his mark \u2013 shooting from No 265 in the world rankings at the start of the year to a career-high 42nd by the end.Along the way, he has taken several high-profile scalps, including the 2020 US Open winner Dominic Thiem and world No 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas. He still needs to improve his fitness and ability to see out big games, but when he does, anything is possible.His fellow Brit Cameron Norrie says he is \u201csure\u201d Draper \u201ccan easily get into the top 10\u201d. Expect Draper to make bounding strides towards that goal in the coming months. It may feel as if footballer Beth Mead has already made her mark. Not only was she the player of the tournament and golden boot winner as England\u2019s women footballers took the Euro 2022 title, she also deservedly won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year and was made an MBE this weekend in the new year honours list. That she was able to achieve all this while her mum suffered with terminal cancer was testament to her talent and resolve.But Mead will once again be a face to watch throughout 2023 \u2013 especially with the Women\u2019s World Cup taking place in Australia and New Zealand this summer. The bookies have made England second favourites behind the USA; however, before then there will be plenty of scrutiny on Mead, given that she suffered a serious anterior cruciate ligament injury in November. But while she faces a race against time to make the World Cup, history shows it is unwise to bet against her \u2013 or her England team.Incredible though it may sound, there are barely 18 months before the Paris 2024 Olympic Games get under way. They promise to be spectacular, with the opening ceremony staged along a 3.8-mile (6km) stretch of the River Seine, the beach volleyball opposite the Eiffel Tower and the equestrian contests at the Palace of Versailles. And in 2023 we will get a taster for what is to come, as qualifying events begin in earnest.The most intriguing of these surely comes in breakdancing \u2013 or breaking, as it is officially known \u2013 which will feature in an Olympics for the first time in 2024. The competition to compete, however, is exceptionally fierce with only 32 dancers worldwide \u2013 16 male, 16 female \u2013 guaranteed a place.Breaking\u2019s emergence as an Olympic sport is quite a leap from its origins in the emerging hip-hop culture of the Bronx in New York in the 1970s. However, it follows the Olympics\u2019 trend of trying to appeal more to younger audiences, with surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing and 3x3 basketball, which all made their debuts in the Tokyo 2020 Games, held in 2021, returning for 2024. Technology by John Naughton To my mind, 2023 looks like being more like 1993 than any other year in recent history. Early that year, programmers Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina released Mosaic, the first modern web browser, and suddenly the non-technical world understood what this strange \u201cinternet\u201d thing was for. We\u2019ve now reached a similar inflection point with AI \u2013 artificial intelligence \u2013 which is really the tech industry\u2019s name for an arcane technology called machine learning. Until now, most people hadn\u2019t a clue what it was about, or indeed what it was for (except, perhaps, automating jobs). But in 2022 a new variant arrived. It\u2019s called \u201cgenerative AI\u201d \u2013 machine-learning systems that can generate plausible artefacts. The Midjourney program, for example, can create an image in response to a prompt such as: \u201cDraw a picture of JK Rowling as an astronaut\u201d. Until now, most people have regarded these systems as interesting toys. But the real killer app of generative AI has just arrived in the form of ChatGPT, a prototype chatbot that can often \u2013 though not always \u2013 generate plausible text in response to a prompt. It can write essays, for example. Or, as one US business school professor asked it, design a 12-session syllabus for a master\u2019s level introduction to an entrepreneurship class. Or do a thousand other things. Of course, it can also write plausible nonsense or ostensibly credible propaganda. It has become wildly popular overnight \u2013 going from zero to 1 million users in five days. This is because everyone intuitively gets that it can do something that they know is useful but personally find difficult. Which means that \u2013 finally \u2013 they understand what this AI thing is for. Expect 2023 to be the year of ChatGPT, therefore. Students will love it. Their teachers will be less keen. How do you grade essays if you don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re written by students or by machines? Assessment systems that depend on written coursework will have to be radically reconceived. Detecting disinformation on the internet will become much more difficult. Elsewhere, Mark Zuckerberg will continue to burn Meta\u2019s money on his fatuous metaverse project. But boring old Facebook will continue to be a stable and profitable business, partly because it\u2019s got your parents, uncles, aunts and grandparents on it. It\u2019ll be like Microsoft Office \u2013 ubiquitous, dependable and dull. Oh, and Elon Musk will continue to try to save Twitter by destroying it. Much like the Americans in Vietnam used to destroy villages in order to save them. TV by Barbara Ellen Sally Wainwright\u2019s suspenseful drama Happy Valley\u2019s return to our screens kicks off a great year for feisty female detectives. The third and final series of the show widely hailed as the UK\u2019s Fargo sees Sarah Lancashire again shrugging on the hi-vis jacket as dauntless West Yorkshire policewoman Sgt Catherine Cawood. She\u2019s looking at retirement but has to once more deal with criminal psychopath Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton), her late daughter\u2019s rapist. Sky Atlantic\u2019s True Detective also returns in 2023. A series with form for prestige leads (Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson, Colin Farrell and Mahershala Ali), it now has Jodie Foster playing a detective, Liz Danvers, in a story set in Alaska. Look out, too, for new BBC One series Better, starring Leila Farzad as a detective compromised by a drug dealer, played by Andrew Buchan in turbo-sinister mode. And, after the death of Nicola Walker\u2019s Cassie Stuart, Sin\u00e9ad Keenan is to appear alongside Sanjeev Bhaskar in the next chapter of ITV\u2019s crime drama Unforgotten. There\u2019ll be some key cast changes in this year\u2019s controversial Paramount+ reboot of Frasier too. Originally running from 1993 to 2004, the show evolved into one of the lodestars of the sitcom galaxy: a triumph of characterisation and pithy scripts. Not only will Frasier 2.0 be missing Crane paterfamilias, Martin (actor John Mahoney died in 2018), but David Hyde Pierce (Niles) reportedly isn\u2019t keen to reprise his character either. Jane Leeves (Daphne) and Peri Gilpin (Roz) will only make guest appearances. Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) went it alone after Cheers \u2013 can he pull it off again? Look out for new faces in 2023. Chaske Spencer gave a stellar turn in Hugo Blick\u2019s innovative BBC Two western The English and he\u2019s up next in Marvel superhero show Echo on Disney+. Thirteen-year-old actor Lenny Rush had a real breakout moment in Daisy May Cooper and Selin Hizli\u2019s dark BBC One comedy Am I Being Unreasonable? The show is back for a new series in 2023 and Rush is also in upcoming episodes of Dodger on CBBC. A second season of the 2022 Disney+ hit The Bear is on the way this year: watch out for Ayo Edebiri, who is a sensitive, micro-expression-fuelled highlight in the note-perfect ensemble cast. International politics by Simon Tisdall The coming year promises scant relief for the besieged people of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, claims civilian infrastructure such as the power grid is a legitimate military target. Russian missile and drone attacks on cities will probably continue until at least the spring. If Ukraine\u2019s government cannot sustain electricity, heat and water supplies \u2013 and it is struggling \u2013 millions more Ukrainians may be forced to leave their homes or flee abroad. A new refugee crisis will add to political strains in European countries already balking at war-related cost of living increases. Russia, too, faces problems with public disillusion. Will Putin\u2019s grip weaken? It\u2019s 2023\u2019s big unknown. Militarily, the war is nowhere near resolution. Spring offensives by both sides, including via co-opted Belarus, are expected. The prospects for genuine negotiations look bleak. Most people, including Putin, agree that talks are the only way to ultimately stop the war. But no one wants to make the first move. EU and Nato leaders insist they will not force Kyiv to make territorial concessions that reward Russian aggression. Their united stance may crack. In China, the collapse of the zero Covid policy was a victory for popular protest and free speech but it may also foreshadow a lethal uptick in cases of the disease among unvaccinated citizens. The U-turn was also a political humiliation for Xi Jinping, China\u2019s autocratic president, that undermined his aura of omniscience. Xi is also grappling with economic and debt problems exacerbated by falling global demand and mismanagement. Like dictators throughout history, he may look abroad to distract attention from his domestic failures. After 2022\u2019s rising tensions, this could be the year Xi resorts to force to fulfil his oft-stated ambition to conquer Taiwan. Israel\u2019s newly elected government, which includes far-right politicians in key positions, could face a fateful moment. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 a veteran hawk \u2013 has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities but has been blocked so far by the US, which rightly fears the consequences. Yet if the west\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran finally collapses, which looks probable, the focus will shift to further punishment of Iran, including possible military action. That in turn would intensify the existing Iran-Israel standoff in Syria and Lebanon, further aggravate tensions in Gaza and the occupied territories, and possibly suck in Russia and the Gulf states. Anti-regime protests in Iran, led by young women, are destabilising the country. Continued unrest may cause the mullahs to lash out in unpredictable ways, at home and abroad. But the chances of a successful second Iranian revolution look remote after sweeping, brutal crackdowns. Culture by Vanessa Thorpe Not every mention of the big book of the new year refers to Prince Harry\u2019s Spare, out in January, or even to Salman Rushdie\u2019s triumphal publication of Victory City a month later. Pundits are also excited by the debut novel from British-Nigerian author Ore Agbaje-Williams, already billed as the bookshop equivalent of Michaela Coel\u2019s TV hit I May Destroy You. Set on one day, The Three of Us is a dark, funny tale that tackles an uncomfortably familiar question: what happens if your partner and your best friend cannot stand each other? The manuscript, originally written as part of a lockdown challenge, prompted a bidding war. Over in the art world, the fight for equal rights inspires one of 2023\u2019s big shows. Tate Britain\u2019s exhibition Women in Revolt! is about campaigning female artists. The show charts works from the 1970s to 1990s inspired by domestic, social and political aspects of women\u2019s lives, including the Equal Pay Act, Greenham Common protests and the Rock Against Racism movement. Women are also the focus of the National Gallery\u2019s The Ugly Duchess: Beauty and Satire in the Renaissance. The show focuses on the way older women have been represented in painting. Flemish artist Quentin Massys\u2019 titular 1513 portrait of a noblewoman, which is also known as An Old Woman, will be on display, paired with its companion artwork, An Old Man, for the first time in 15 years. Children also get some attention when the Young V&A opens this summer. The former V&A Museum of Childhood in east London\u2019s Bethnal Green has been radically reimagined with a \u00a313m investment. The new space will celebrate and inform visitors about childhood and play, and dispel any youthfully wrong-headed idea that exhibitions are boring. The gallery\u2019s official mission is to become \u201cthe world\u2019s most joyful museum\u201d. Politics by Toby Helm After a turbulent 2022 in which Tory prime ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss were tossed overboard and the economy all but imploded after a burst of economic experimentalism by the latter, 2023 cannot surely be as dramatic. The challenge for Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer over the next 12 months will be to show they can steady the ship of state. Economic radicalism has gone dramatically out of fashion post-Truss. One theme of 2023 will therefore be the efforts of both men to reinstil confidence in political leadership. Expect duller politics, with premiums on competence, fiscal prudence and claims to greater probity. The perilous condition of the UK economy will dominate, along with cost of living pressures. All eyes will be on the contest, which could decide the political colour of the next government, between the new technocratic and middle ground of the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and the increasingly confident and competent-sounding shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who is also a believer in tight financial control. How bad things get economically for the country and how that plays out politically will depend on how deeply we sink into recession, which in turn will rest in large part on what happens in Ukraine. If the war ends quickly, energy prices drop and inflation falls, the Tories may start to build some kind of green-shoots-of-recovery or war-victory story to tell. But if the conflict grinds on through 2023 and prices remain high, it is hard to see how they can claw back a 15 to 20 percentage point deficit in the polls. The damage to the Conservatives\u2019 economic credibility caused by the Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget will be difficult to heal in a decade, let alone in the two years or so until the next general election. Talk of that next election will grow during 2023, with Labour sure to up its demands. The opposition\u2019s core messages are becoming clearer: successive years of Tory failure since 2010, capped and encapsulated by that catastrophic mini-budget, which pushed up borrowing rates and has left millions facing increased mortgage payments during 2023. Into that will feed the failings of a Tory-driven Brexit that will be exploited most loudly by the Scottish National party as it pushes the dual causes of independence and re-entry into the European mainstream. Watch out too for the newish Reform UK party, formed out of the ashes of the Brexit party and now determined to mop up disgruntled voters on the nationalist right, doing potential damage to Tory chances in \u201cred wall\u201d seats. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, will try to maintain their comeback, focusing on winning seats in which they are second to the Tories. After the storms of 2022, expect politics to assume a clearer, less chaotic form in 2023 as Labour tries to sell itself as a reliable credible party of government after 13 years out in the cold. Cost of living by Zoe Wood The biggest fall in living standards since records began is the hellish prediction no one wants to read for the coming year. But, sadly, that is what the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s spending watchdog, has already divined in the economic tea leaves for Britons in 2023. How does that stack up, you might be asking? After all, 2022 was pretty terrible. Well, there is a list of fresh woes to consider that includes higher taxes and borrowing costs, half a million recession-related job losses and continuing cost of living pressures. If you are wondering who will be most affected by the bad news, it could be you, with economists saying those on \u201cmiddling\u201d incomes will feel the most pain because their taxes are rising, their wages are falling and the government is withdrawing help such as the universal energy bills support scheme. After last year\u2019s cost of living horror show, the worst of the price rises may be behind us: official data points to inflation having peaked at just over 11%. But as Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown, put it, the \u201cjourney down from the summit may not be as fast as the nosebleed-inducing ascent\u201d, with higher energy and food costs still fuelling inflation into 2023. The air is also expected to leak out of the UK\u2019s gravity-defying housing market, but how fast is anyone\u2019s guess. The general view is that prices will fall but there is no agreement on the magnitude \u2013 and forecasters have been wrong on this before. This time, though, there are factors such as the jump in borrowing costs that increase the likelihood of a downturn. The Bank of England has raised interest rates steadily since December 2021 from a record low of 0.1% to close the year at 3.5% (which, of course, after years of low rates, is good news for savers). Just over a year ago, it was possible to lock into an interest rate of less than 1% on a two or five-year mortgage deal, but today the figure starts with a 5, which is bad news for the 1.8 million people whose fixed rate deals end in 2023, with big hikes in their monthly mortgage payments. Energy bills will also go up again in the spring as the government\u2019s energy price guarantee, which has capped typical energy bills at \u00a32,500 this winter, resets at \u00a33,000. There will also be no repeat of the \u00a3400 energy bills help for all, with the new cost-of-living support package aimed at pensioners and low-income households. Happy new year! Lifestyle by Morwenna Ferrier Integral to menswear yet rarely seen on womenswear, pockets look set to be the big trend for 2023. It\u2019s more than 10 years since designer Raf Simons sewed a pocket on a couture Christian Dior gown, yet the freedom to carry your keys on your person \u2013 a long-standing feminist issue \u2013 isn\u2019t something offered by fashion. But this season, from Miu Miu to Chanel, Isabel Marant and Louis Vuitton, pockets appeared on skirts, jackets and tops. This is partly due to the influence of the return to the 00s \u2013 multipocketed cargo pants were on all the catwalks \u2013 and social media helped the trend when a Marine Serre unisex khaki green jumpsuit, covered almost entirely with pockets, went momentarily viral after the show. Can we finally throw away our handbags? A good year for pockets may be a complicated year for bottoms, as laid out in Heather Radke\u2019s ambitious new pop culture book Butts: A Backstory, which looks at the history of our behinds through the prism of race, gender and class. Don\u2019t be deceived by the peachy emoji on the cover \u2013 this is serious stuff. It features Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec\u2019s sex workers, diet culture and 1980s buns-of-steel workouts, as well as singer Nicki Minaj and the Kardashians \u2013 who most recently changed the discourse around what men supposedly desired and what women supposedly aspired to. What next for bums \u2013 and what does this all mean for our bodies? There is change afoot too for our most vital internal organ in 2023, if the emerging nootropic market has anything to do with it. Nootropics, or smart drugs, are cognitive enhancers that are meant to have a positive effect on your mental ability. They\u2019re part of brain care, an emerging wellness category that hopes to do to your mind what Goop has done to your abs. Born in part out of the pandemic, which arguably put a spotlight on mental health, these supplements, so the idea goes, will replace more familiar stimulants such as caffeine in the search for a sharp mind. They promise better memory, improved focus and higher energy levels, and usually come as a pill or a non-alcoholic cocktail. No 8, Kin Euphorics and Heights are among the nootropic brands to watch out for if you\u2019re curious. As to whether they work, be warned: there\u2019s insufficient data on whether they\u2019re effective or even safe. Environment by Ashish Ghadiali Annual carbon emissions were projected to hit 40.6bn tonnes in 2022 \u2013 close to the record level of 40.9bn tonnes in 2019 \u2013 according to leading scientists behind the influential Global Carbon Project. It was also reported that we will probably go beyond 1.5C global heating within nine years unless positive change kicks in imminently. This makes 2023 decisive for climate action, and a potential watershed moment takes place in Brazil on 1 January, when a new presidential term begins for Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who saw off the country\u2019s outgoing leader, Jair Bolsonaro, in a tightly fought election in October and has promised to protect the Amazon and work towards zero deforestation. Deforestation, after fossil fuel emissions, is a huge driver of climate breakdown, and the last four years under Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency have seen \u201can area of the Amazon twice the size of Wales\u201d destroyed, according to Greenpeace Brazil campaigner Cristiane Mazzetti. \u201cPromises by Lula to reverse this are encouraging,\u201d said Mazzetti, \u201cbut it will not be easy. Environmental crime [which claimed the lives of the Guardian journalist Dom Phillips and indigenous expert Bruno Pereira in June 2022] is out of control. Lula will need to strengthen and empower environmental agencies dismantled under Bolsonaro and re-establish the state\u2019s capacity to curb environmental crime.\u201d At intergovernmental level, climate finance will be another priority issue in 2023. Simultaneously, this needs to support the rapid decarbonisation of the world economy, strengthen adaptation to the climate crisis and fund loss and damage (after the establishment of a loss and damage fund at Cop27) in the communities \u2013 predominantly in the global south \u2013 suffering the worst effects of climate breakdown. Now known as the Bridgetown initiative, the proposals for how this could be achieved have been formulated by Barbados\u2019s prime minister, Mia Mottley, and her adviser Avinash Persaud, and are gaining ground at the world\u2019s multilateral institutions. June will be a pivotal moment for this initiative; this is when French president Emmanuel Macron will hold a summit in Paris focused on building support for the Bridgetown proposals and aiming to establish a \u201cnew financial pact with the global south\u201d before the G7 meeting in Japan. Closer to home, 2023 will also see the clean air (human rights) bill move through the UK parliament. The bill is also known as Ella\u2019s law, in tribute to Ella Kissi-Debrah, who died at the age of nine in 2013. Thanks to the campaigning of her mother, Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, an activist based in Lewisham, south London, she became the first person in the world to have air pollution recorded on her death certificate as the cause of death. This weekend her mother was made a CBE in the new year honours for services to public health. The bill successfully passed through the Lords last month, with a second reading scheduled in the Commons in February, and if passed will ultimately establish the statutory right to clean air across England and Wales. Science by Robin McKie Starship \u2013 the first fully reusable heavy-lift launcher, which is being developed by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX company \u2013 is set to make its maiden orbital flight this year. It comprises a \u201csuper heavy\u201d first-stage booster and a Starship second-stage spacecraft, with the rocket stages designed to be reused after landing vertically post-launch. Musk claims Starship rivals Nasa\u2019s Artemis launcher system in lift power but will cost only a fraction to launch. He believes the craft will become the main vehicle for humans to return to the moon and then on to Mars. However, Starship will have another rival. The New Glenn rocket \u2013 another huge reusable launcher, which is being developed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin \u2013 is also scheduled to make its maiden flight this year. Other intriguing missions scheduled for launch in 2023 include the European Space Agency\u2019s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or Juice, which will blast off in April and arrive at Jupiter in 2031. It will study three Jovian moons \u2013 Europa, Callisto and Ganymede \u2013 whose ice-covered oceans could provide homes for living organisms. In addition, Nasa is sending a spacecraft to an asteroid called Psyche, which is orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter and is believed to be the iron core of a young planet that could reveal secrets about the metallic interior of our own world. The Psyche mission will launch in October and arrive at Jupiter in 2029. In the wake of the success of mRNA vaccines that helped tame the Covid-19 pandemic in the west, similar attempts to immunise against other diseases are in development. Germany company BioNTech is expected to start human trials for mRNA vaccines against malaria and tuberculosis in a few months, Nature reported last month. The journal added that biotech rival Moderna, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, also has mRNA vaccine candidates for the viruses that cause genital herpes and shingles. Scientists have also reported encouraging progress using Crispr gene-editing therapy to treat beta thalassaemia and sickle-cell disease, two of the world\u2019s most deadly inherited blood disorders. The technique is being developed by a pair of Massachusetts-based companies, Vertex Pharmaceuticals in Boston and Crispr Therapeutics in Cambridge. During the process, a patient\u2019s stem cells are collected and later, using Crispr technology, put back into their veins. Vertex is expected to apply to the US Food and Drug Administration in March for approval to begin trials this year.",

            "title": "Expert tips: How to stop work anxiety from sabotaging your vacation",
            "text": "Last year, Madison Winey, 29, wanted to use her vacation days to drive from San Francisco, where she lives, to Bend, Oregon, to visit her family. But taking time off from her job as a lawyer always felt like \u201cmore stress than it\u2019s worth, especially if you\u2019re just going away for a couple of days,\u201d she said. She would have to start planning for her absence weeks before leaving, and she was expected to provide times when she would check emails. She had scheduled the visit when she thought there would be a bit of a lull at work \u2014 but a project timeline was delayed by two weeks, forcing her to postpone her trip. \u201cAll I needed was nine hours on a Saturday to be able to drive up to Oregon, and I wasn\u2019t even able to take that,\u201d she said. When she finally made it to Oregon, she worked the whole time. Despite decades of research that has found that taking time off is good for workers\u2019 mental and physical health, Winey\u2019s experience is not unique. For those who are fortunate enough to receive paid time off at work, the majority of whom are full-time office workers, using those precious days can also create anxiety about re-entry. In a survey in November, the career website Monster found that 87 per cent of over 1,000 American workers across industries experienced post-vacation stress and anxiety, which the company named \u201cP.T.O. woes,\u201d and that 72 per cent of workers refrained from taking vacation at all to avoid that stress. Psychologists and therapists classify post-vacation angst as anticipatory anxiety, a generic term to describe fear and worry about bad things that might happen in the future. Dr. Rebecca Brendal, president of the American Psychiatric Association, likened the experience to the Sunday scaries, a term that has become popular on social media to refer to the dread one feels at the end of the weekend about going back to work. It is a cause for concern during this holiday season because it dovetails with a sharp increase in burnout among workers in recent months, she said. \u201cWe know that mental health concerns are up and anxiety is up. The stress that Americans are facing every day has gotten to the point that taking time off has become stressful,\u201d Dr. Brendal said. In one widely cited study, published in 2000, researchers found that vacationing every year reduced overall risk of death. Brooks Gump, a professor of public health at Syracuse University and a co-author of that paper, ran a similar study last year. He and his team found that while workers with low-stress jobs felt calmer and less anxious before, during and after a vacation, those feelings didn\u2019t seem to extend to those in high-stress jobs. \u201cCertain positions allow you to ease out and back into work, but high-stress jobs don\u2019t really provide that context for a true break,\u201d Dr. Gump said. Morra Aarons-Mele, author of \u201cThe Anxious Achiever,\u201d said she hears about this phenomenon often as a consultant for corporate teams. \u201cSo few work cultures actually encourage people to unplug, and most view working all the time as a badge of honor,\u201d she said. Eventually, Ms. Winey left the law firm for a role that was less client-focused and more flexible \u2014 but not everyone can just quit. And a large part of workers\u2019 ability to take time off at all, much less enjoy it, is dependent on their industry or company culture. Still, if you are able to get that vacation time, there are small steps you can take to minimize stress and reap its many benefits. CREATE AN \u201cOFFRAMP\u201d More than half of the respondents to Monster\u2019s survey reported having to work overtime in order to catch up when they returned from paid time off. One way to help minimize the stress on your first day back is to carve out time for it before you leave, creating an \u201cofframp\u201d for yourself, said Simone Stolzoff, author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Good Enough Job.\u201d \u201cOfframping is basically time you spend, while you\u2019re still on the clock, to prepare for what you might do when you\u2019re back on the clock,\u201d he said. You can make a list of priorities to tackle when you\u2019re back, find co-workers who are willing to handle time-sensitive tasks while you\u2019re out or set up time to catch up with them when you\u2019re back. Prepare everyone around you before you leave, Dr. Brendal said. \u201cEffective managers and leaders who I try to emulate will start putting their out of office message up a week before they actually go out,\u201d she noted. \u201cWhen I first saw that, I would think, \u2018Why are they signaling their vacation a week in advance?\u2019 And then I realized it\u2019s to set reasonable expectations.\u201d Whether you set your out-of-office message before your trip or at the outset, Dr. Brendal said, be clear about whom can be contacted in your absence in the case of a real crisis. Also, include a realistic time by which you will respond, which might be a few days after you return and dig yourself out of the email pile. USE TECHNOLOGY TO YOUR ADVANTAGE If your workplace uses additional communication platforms, like Slack or Microsoft Teams, set detailed away messages on those as well. You may even want to delete work apps from your phone or, at least, turn their notifications off. Making it clear in your away messages that you will be completely detached enables you to truly unplug. Khemaridh Hy, a 43-year-old entrepreneur, still remembers coming back from his honeymoon 10 years ago to a mountain of email from his job at the financial firm BlackRock. Any lingering relaxation was wiped out. \u201cI swear, I probably sprouted my first gray hairs on that flight back, because there were like 1,700 unread messages,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019re damned if you do and you\u2019re damned if you don\u2019t: If you do check your email and stay on top of things, then your spouse is like, \u2018You\u2019re always thinking about work.\u2019 But if you don\u2019t, you know that the minute you turn this thing back on, your life\u2019s going to suck,\u201d he said. Though his honeymoon was 10 years ago, it still stands out in his memory as a vacation that, though enjoyable, also caused him a lot of anxiety \u2014 a feeling that has continued almost every time he has taken a vacation since then. Now, Mr. Hy uses email filters to keep his inbox from becoming overwhelming. \u201cI always filter out a message where I\u2019m not in the \u201cTo\u201d line. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t read it, but I won\u2019t prioritize reading it,\u201d he said. ALLOW YOURSELF SOME (LIMITED) CHECK-INS As counterintuitive as it sounds, if the emails at the other end of a vacation are keeping you up at night, you can schedule pockets of time during your vacation to just clean out the inbox, said Ms. Aarons-Mele, who almost always spends some time during vacations staying on top of messages. She\u2019ll also share that plan with her husband so that they can hold each other accountable. \u201cHe\u2019ll be like, \u2018I have a call at 2 p.m. but I\u2019m not going to be online other than that.\u2019 And I\u2019ll say, \u2018I am checking email today, but tomorrow I won\u2019t,\u2019\u201d she said. Those specific, limited goals, she said, can keep work from taking over an entire day. Alternatively, you can recruit a work buddy to text you an update every now and then, reassuring you that things are going smoothly, said Laura Vanderkam, author of \u201cTranquility by Tuesday: 9 Ways to Calm the Chaos and Make Time for What Matters.\u201d She said it was \u201ckind of the equivalent of reading through 300 emails but much more efficient.\u201d BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT DOING NONWORK ACTIVITIES. You may need to make a plan for what you will do with your free time so that you are not tempted to check in or think about work. Many American workers have \u201cinternalized this belief that if we aren\u2019t getting ahead, then we\u2019re somehow falling behind,\u201d Mr. Stolzoff said. \u201cOur idea of self-worth and identity has just become so wrapped up in productivity that when we\u2019re not being productive, we believe we are somehow less than.\u201d As a result, \u201cpeople get caught in a sort of chicken-and-egg problem where they work all the time so they don\u2019t know what to do when they aren\u2019t working, and because they don\u2019t know what to do when they aren\u2019t working, they end up working all the time,\u201d he said. This is often a problem for Ms. Aarons-Mele when she takes time off. \u201cI\u2019m the worst \u2014 I\u2019ll wake up at a beach resort and be like, \u2018Now what?\u2019\u201d To avoid falling into that trap, she said, you can schedule activities during your vacation that require focus: Sign up for a class, volunteer with an organization or visit a museum, whatever feels fulfilling and distracts you from your screens. PLAN A FUN DAY FOR WHEN YOU GET BACK If you\u2019re able to space out your return home and your back-to-office day, put something on your calendar that you can look forward to for that time in between, Ms. Vanderkam said. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re taking a trip and you come back the day before you start work. Maybe plan a get-together with friends that afternoon or go see a movie that night,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll ensure you are not fixated on the thought of starting work the next day. You\u2019ll likely be thinking about the fun still to come as opposed to the anxiety of starting work.\u201d REMEMBER: THE WORST OUTCOMES PROBABLY WON\u2019T PLAY OUT A lot of times, the scenes that you envision about all the things that could go haywire at work while you\u2019re away or the daunting situations you have to come back to are just your brain inventing catastrophes, said Bisma Anwar, a licensed therapist on the telehealth platform Talkspace: \u201cWe tend to build up things in our minds, and it\u2019s usually not as bad as we think.\u201d To pull yourself out of that mind-set, Ms. Anwar suggested, ground yourself in the moment by meditating or working out so that bad thoughts don\u2019t ruin your time off. While doing so, you can look back on all you achieved before vacation, Ms. Aarons-Mele said, \u201cand tell yourself, I worked hard, I did a lot, I accomplished a lot, I deserve a break.\u201d And if you\u2019re away for an extended period, remind yourself that most issues that come up at work in the first few days will probably be irrelevant by the time you return, Ms. Vanderkam said, so there isn\u2019t much point worrying about them from a distance. If something is important enough for your attention, it will come up again when you\u2019re back at work and ready to address it.

U.S. stock markets will be closed Monday in observance of the New Year\u2019s Day holiday. Over the weekend, a report showed that Chinese manufacturing contracted for a third consecutive month in December, in the biggest drop since February 2020, as the country grapples with a nationwide COVID-19 surge after suddenly easing anti-epidemic measures. A monthly purchasing managers\u2019 index declined to 47.0 from 48.0 in November, according to data released from the National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday. Numbers below 50 indicate a contraction in activity. China is in the process of removing strict COVID-19 policies that crimped production for raw materials and goods and discouraged travel. It's uncertain what impact the reopening will have on the global economy. The minutes of the Fed's meeting potentially will give investors more insight into its next moves.

On Friday, U.S. markets logged more losses in quiet trading, closing the book on the worst year for the benchmark S&P 500 since 2008. The S&P 500 fell 0.3% to 3,839.50. It posted a 5.9% loss for the month of December and a 19.4% decline in 2022, or 18.1%, including dividends. That's just its third annual decline since the financial crisis 14 years ago and a painful reversal for investors after the S&P 500 notched a gain of nearly 27% in 2021. All told, the index lost $8.2 trillion in value, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The Dow dropped 0.2% on Friday to close at 33,147.25, down 8.8% for the year. The Nasdaq slipped 0.1% to 10,466.48, racking up an annual loss of 33.1%. The Russell 2000 shed 0.3%, ending at 1,761.25. Stocks struggled all year as pandemic stimulus was withdrawn and inflation put increasing pressure on consumers, raising fears that economies may slip into recession. Central banks raised interest rates to fight high prices. The Fed\u2019s key lending rate stood at a range of 0% to 0.25% at the beginning of 2022 and closed the year at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% after seven increases. The U.S. central bank forecasts that will reach a range of 5% to 5.25% by the end of 2023. Its forecast doesn\u2019t call for a rate cut before 2024. Rising interest rates prompted investors to sell the high-priced shares of technology giants such as Apple and Microsoft and other companies that flourished as the economy recovered from the pandemic. Amazon and Netflix lost roughly 50% of their market value. Tesla and Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, each dropped more than 60%, their biggest-ever annual declines. Russia's invasion of Ukraine worsened inflationary pressure earlier in the year by making oil, gas and food commodity prices even more volatile amid existing supply chain issues.

            "text": "When good technology does the job of an amateur poet, it is time to wake up. I spent New Year's Eve, getting introduced to ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot from OpenAI that appears poised to shake up the world of technology (which includes Google, thank you)\u2014and by extension, the world in general.Wait, there is too much technology out there, and whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets to keep his seat in 2024 or not, indications are clear that scientists and assorted geeks are set to storm the planet from various directions in 2023\u2014 some providing confusing challenges to policymakers and regulators (as cryptocurrency is doing after a bubble flop in 2022).Here's what ChatGPT did when I asked it to craft me a message to wish a speedy recovery for ace Cricketer Rishabh Pant after he suffered injuries in a bad car accident. Without my prompting, it offered poetry....er, rhyme. But it had plenty of reasons. So here goes its first two stanzas:Your skills and talent, we all do gleamBut now you're hurt, and that's no funWe wish for you, a speedy recovery, oh one. The cricket field is where you belongYour fierce determination, never goneBut now you rest, to heal and mendWe hope for you, a quick end to this trend.Google Fires Engineer Who Claimed AI Has Come to Life \u2013 Should You Be Worried?To cut a long story short, if Google gave you smart search results, Microsoft-backed ChatGPT can turn it into a nice little conversation piece, including amazing poetry if you consider that it is just a computer network on steroids that did it, using residual intelligence and information stored across the Internet.Technology Wins?We are told Google is worried but also that Google has its own competing offering called the Pathways Language Model (PaLM). Whoever does it, we can say in the manner in which Ravi Shastri praises cricket at the end of keenly contested matches that technology is the winner.The jury is still out on whether ChatGPT is good enough to take on Google but there is enough ammo in it to grossly displace Instagram's vanity poets who write stuff only slightly better than the \"I love you, jaanu' that you see scrawled on small-town college walls.I feel like writing a dystopic futuristic sci-fi plot in which news editors get sacked because artificial intelligence can do their jobs even as social media-fattened readers cannot tell the difference between a real TV anchor and a deep fake video character. That saves salary bills. This depressing equilibrium in which the increasing intelligence of machines matches the progressive mechanisation of the audience is the stuff of black comedy.But in case you didn't notice, even elections are getting as easy as ordering food on your smartphone.Voting via Smart Phone is Rife With RiskIn the last week of 2022, the Election Commission of India announced that it is ready to pilot remote voting for domestic migrants, so they don\u2019t have to travel back to their home states to cast their ballots. Opposition parties, who fear EVM (electronic voting machine) rigging, are even more worried. In the high-tech world, what you cannot figure out scares you.But the homemade ECI's prototype for a Multi-Constituency Remote Electronic Voting Machine (RVM) that can handle multiple constituencies from a single remote polling booth is still a box. When you network such machines, the way you do smartphones already, the possibilities can boggle the mind.One of the byproducts of the bitcoin/cryptocurrency surge is the blockchain technology that can potentially revolutionise elections. Here is what ChatGPT, my assistant in writing this article, told me about the technology: \"Blockchain is a decentralised, distributed digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.\"Picture it like a CCTV for all votes in a connected network with no scope to erase footprints.A website appropriately called geeksforgeeks.org tells us that EVM circuits can be tampered with but if you use blockchain in voting \"it stores everything as a transaction\" and gives you a transaction ID for your vote (much like money transfers in Net banking). Out go logistical hassles of transporting EVMs and fears of booth capturing and ballot tampering. Future elections can be practically virtualised.Er, can mid-term elections now be ordered like some product on Amazon?At this rate, my election dystopia novel may precede my editor-tale dystopia oeuvre.We Taught AI to Impersonate Shakespeare & Oscar Wilde \u2013 Here\u2019s What It RevealedKeep an Eye on the Tech!I am not even going anywhere near stem cells, gene mapping, cybercrime and such things. There is enough stuff in emerging technologies and what they can do in the world of humans for a hundred Netflix documentaries and Amazon Prime series. All you need to know is that technology is progressing faster than you can possibly figure out and this may put government agencies in embarrassing situations, not to speak of business entities.I found it difficult telling a TV channel last week that India does not have data privacy laws in place even as data collection is crossing acceptable limits.As one wishes you a happy and prosperous 2023, a pro tip: Watch technology more than you watch politicians. One of the two is highly predictable, while the other is likely to be more useful or disruptive.(Madhavan Narayanan is a senior journalist and commentator who has worked for Reuters, Economic Times, Business Standard, and Hindustan Times.
