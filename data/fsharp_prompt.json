I will ask it something like, \u201CHey, ChatGPT, how do you think AI chatbots like yourself will impact the publishing industry in the years to come?\u201D and it starts yammering on about how it \u201Cdoesn\u2019t know anything about a ChatGPT.\u201D Sorta like a cross between a mafioso pleading the fifth and your geriatric uncle trying to remember whether he killed a guy in Korea or not, ChatGPT occasionally just can\u2019t bring itself to answer your question. Algorithm malfunction or cagey evasiveness? You decide... Yessss...turns out, ChatGPT can be quite NSFW when it wants to be. In a bout of inspired depravity, I once instructed it to write me an erotic story involving an Octopus and it dutifully obliged. Then there\u2019s Twitch streamer Jordan Raskopoulos, who recently prompted the chatbot to write a dirty tale about Scooby Doo and got more than he bargained for. Let\u2019s face it: the advent of robot smut is officially here and we are all really happy about it. Right, guys? Right? If this robot is really good at performing absolutely mission critical tasks like writing pervy stories, it apparently isn\u2019t so great at lesser tasks, like computer coding. While there was initially some hubbub about the chatbot\u2019s abilities to do a software programmer\u2019s work for them, it was swiftly revealed that ChatGPT had a problem with inserting gibberish into codebases. To head off a swarm of coding BS, software site Stack Overflow decided to ban ChatGPT from its digital premises for the foreseeable future: \u201COverall, because the average rate of getting correct answers from ChatGPT is too low, the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking and looking for correct answers,\u201D admins wrote. Sounds fair! Concerns are high when it comes to how this weirdly articulate chatbot will impact and/or disrupt academia. Will ChatGPT kill the college essay? Will it make teachers irrelevant? More importantly, will it lead to a tsunami of cheating from high school slackers who just want a robot to write their history essay for them already? The New York City Department of Education certainly seems to think so, because it just banned ChatGPT on all school networks and devices. No word yet on whether other cities plan to follow suit. Turns out one thing robots are good at is writing stories about robots. We actually got it to write an entire science fiction story for us, though we had to try and retry prompts to make it coherent. Was the story good? Ehhhh...well, not exactly. But, tbh, I\u2019ve read worse! ChatGPT crossed the 100-million mark of monthly active users in early February 2023, despite only launching in November of the previous year, according to an analysis from the bank UBS. It\u2019s among the fastest-growing applications in history, with roughly 13 million unique visitors daily. Microsoft is investing some $10 billion in OpenAI to forge a partnership with the fledgling AI pioneer (Google is very worried). To that end, the office software giant rolled out a premium version of its office chat software Teams in early February 2023, which will generate meeting notes and to-do lists, among other things. It\u2019ll cost $7 per user until the price ramps up to $10 a head in July 2023.\n\n\u003C\u003CWhat Can ChatGPT Do For Healthcare Practices? | Entrepreneur - WorldNewsEra\u003E\u003E\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly permeated various industries, showcasing its transformative potential in solving complex problems and streamlining processes. Healthcare is no exception to this trend. With the integration of AI, healthcare practices are experiencing unprecedented advancements, ultimately leading to improved patient care and outcomes. One such AI-driven innovation is the emergence of chatbots in healthcare. These digital assistants help healthcare professionals manage their workload and enhance patient experiences. In this article, you\u2019ll learn more about ChatGPT, including how it can benefit healthcare practices, streamline administrative tasks and empower medical professionals to deliver top-notch patient care. What is ChatGPT and how has it evolved? To fully appreciate the potential of ChatGPT in healthcare, it\u2019s essential to understand its origins and the technology behind it. ChatGPT was born out of groundbreaking research and development by OpenAI, an organization focused on creating cutting-edge AI solutions. The foundation of ChatGPT lies in large language models designed to understand and generate human-like text. But what led to the creation of ChatGPT? Its predecessor, GPT-3, laid the groundwork for this powerful AI tool. GPT-3, or the third iteration of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer, gained significant attention for its ability to produce coherent and contextually relevant text. Building upon the success of GPT-3, ChatGPT \u2014 using what Open AI dubbed \u201CGPT 3.5\u201D \u2014 enhances these capabilities even further, providing more accurate and conversational responses. The secret behind ChatGPT\u2019s prowess lies in the combination of transformer algorithms and machine learning techniques. Transformer algorithms enable the AI to process and understand the context within a given text. At the same time, machine learning allows it to learn from vast amounts of data and improve over time. This potent combination makes ChatGPT an increasingly powerful and adaptive AI tool. Related: ChatGPT: What Is It and How Does It Work? The key to AI success: quality and scope of datasets Critical to the success of AI models like ChatGPT is the quality and scope of the datasets used in their training. Comprehensive datasets are essential for enhancing the performance of AI models, as they enable them to understand more comprehensively and generate more accurate responses. These datasets must encompass a diverse range of: Subjects: Covering various topics ensures the AI model is knowledgeable and can provide relevant information. Contexts: Understanding different contexts allows the AI to deliver appropriate and contextually accurate responses. Languages: Including multiple languages enables the AI model to cater to a broader audience and communicate effectively. As ChatGPT continues to learn from an ever-expanding pool of data, its potential applications within the healthcare industry have become increasingly promising.
